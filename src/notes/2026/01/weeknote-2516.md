Another week rolls by, the third of 2026.

This week the work focus has been on something to do with SharePoint, if I'm honest I thought those days were well behind me.

At home I have been looking a broken Sage Oracle Touch coffee machine. This has been repaired twice by Sage and once again crapped out. The search has been simple, very simple. I want a simple mechanical machine that if it breaks I can fix it.

## Notes
- [Gaggia Classic](https://www.gaggia.com/manual-machines/new-classic/)
- [Ranchilio Silvia](https://www.ranciliogroup.com/rancilio/silvia/)

This then lead me down a rabbit hole of modern mods, until I stumbled across the [Gaggimate](https://shop.gaggimate.eu) and I am now trying to understand pressure profiles and brew recipes.
