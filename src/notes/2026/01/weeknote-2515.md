Going to try something new, post a note every so often with any links or updates for the week.

Yes, it is very much lifted from [Rob](https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1949/)’s idea. What is it they… say about great ideas and those or copy or invent them.

This week there has not been many interesting items to post, just a shock to the system with a return to work. It also marked the beginning of a new training year, which I will write up my plans and goals; you know accountability and all that.
