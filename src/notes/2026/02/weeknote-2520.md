Been a long week in the house. Of course it has been the same seven days as normal but it has just felt like it is dragging.

Made a couple of decisions regarding digital data. I have gone all in on the Garmin eco-system, so much so I have deleted all data stored on the phone and within Apple Health. This is based upon signing up for a couple of events and really wanting to focus on the process and goals and not just distracted by all the other numbers and syncing headaches from there.

The one caveat to this is that I have resurrected my [HRV4Training](https://www.hrv4training.com) account. Historically I was always a massive fan of [Marco](https://marcoaltini.substack.com) and his work, but for some reason the last couple of iPhones have really not worked for me and the morning measurements. Even now I can not get a minute's worth of data without frustrations getting in the way and making the data bit biased. So I'm using a HRM-Pro strap and so far it is looking good.
