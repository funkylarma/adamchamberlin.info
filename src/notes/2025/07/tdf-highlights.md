This year, 2025, is the last year that the United Kingdom will be able to enjoy free coverage and highlights of the Tour de France.

ITV currently has the broadcast rights for some live coverage and then produces a daily highlight show in the evening. In 2026, all this content will be paywalled by Discovery+, so I’m making the most of it and using ITV as my go-to source.

Yesterday’s rest day still comes with a highlight show, but this time they went deep down memory lane and even had a wonderful piece with Phil Leggett and the original Channel 4 coverage. During the article, they aired the opening credits from that show and the viral theme music that shaped my Julys as a child.

If you get the chance, have a [watch](https://www.itv.com/watch/tour-de-france-highlights/10a5559/10a5559a0035) and see just how far we have come from a technical standpoint; unfortunately, you then realise just how much we will lose next year.
