Over the festive period I have managed to carve out some time to update this site.

Last year I migrated all the content over to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and promptly left it to gather dust. Which meant the first order of call was to update to version 3. After that I found myself on the IndieWeb site with the long term goal of 'owning my own data'.

Since then I have created a few note content types for [rsvp](https://adamchamberlin.info/category/rsvp/)'s and [replies](https://adamchamberlin.info/category/reply/), along with importing my Swarm [checkins](https://adamchamberlin.info/category/checkin/).

My next step is to bring in some data from online, I'm especially looking at trying to find a way to store and display fit/gpx files.
