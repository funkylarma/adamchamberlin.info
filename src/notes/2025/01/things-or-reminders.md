Last night I re-installed [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) on my devices. Until around three months ago I have been a long time user of Things, but with the release of iOS18 I decided to try Reminders.

Whilst I really appreciate the ability to set location based reminders, Reminders has a key issue for me. It only reminds me, not gives be a place to build and construct my to-dos and manage ongoing projects. My ideal world appears to be a mixture of the both. When I get to work Reminders and give me a nudge to charge my lights but I need Things power to collect the daily work tasks.
