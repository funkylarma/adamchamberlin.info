2025's goal to 'own my data' is going well, the main hurdles I'm finding are how I interrupt the way in which I should display or post my activities from other platforms.

Today I'm thinking about the 'repost' or 'boost' of an article. What does that mean?
On Mastodon it is clear, I am repeating the post to my circle of followers.
Yet, to have this display on my site how should that look?

Is it just a link to the original content?

So how is this different to a like?
