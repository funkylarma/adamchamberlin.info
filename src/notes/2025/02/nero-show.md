Last night's commute I started [The Nero Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/ae/podcast/the-nero-show/id1659229051) to find it was a **special guest** episode with Jonathan Lee from [TrainerRoad](https://www.trainerroad.com/).

Whilst I have been listened to just about every episode of the [Ask a Cycling Coach Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ae/podcast/ask-a-cycling-coach-podcast-presented-by-trainerroad/id1035433041), but hearing Jonathan wax lyrical about training methodologies and human physiology was outstanding. He presented himself and by proxy TrainerRoad really well and broke through the Aussie *sookiness*
