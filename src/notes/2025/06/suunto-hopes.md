Over a year ago I handed my Garmin Forerunner 955 to Lucy and put a Suunto Race on my wrist. I knew that the Suunto would not have all the bells and feature whistles of the Garmin, that was part of my choice.

Every morning I was swamped by numbers and reports about how I should feel. Each workout provided more data that a SpaceX launch and more often that not I was just told that I was not progressing or being productive. There is only so much of that you can take!

Knowing the Suunto did not have these metrics was a feature to me. That said there are a few drawbacks that I really miss:

## Sensor Management
You can only have one sensor of one type connected at a time. When I say connected I mean known to the watch. So I can not pair multiple power meters to the watch and just have it pick the one that is active. If I change bikes I need to forget the sensor, and then re-pair the new one.
Not ideal.

## Interval Notifications
There is no arguing that interval training is the best bang for buck and I lean in heavily on this. Most of the sessions are planned in [Training Peaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com) and then pushed to the watch. When performing the sessions there is no countdown to the interval or any interval target feedback. If you are doing some high intensity work then having a three second countdown really helps when going into the work interval. Plus just a vibration on the wrist if you need to speed up or down would be great.

Since owning the watch I have been a regular lurker on the [user forums](https://forum.suunto.com/) to understand Suunto's update cycles. They are pretty sparse but documented; one upgrade every quarter. So in June I'm really hoping for some features to my pain points along with a couple of new features touted in the latest [Run](https://www.suunto.com/en-gb/Products/sports-watches/suunto-run/suunto-run-lime/) watch.
