Before my workshop last week, I made some [changes](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/new-and-improved-compound-grid-generator) to my Compound grid generator. After the workshop, I made a new grid generator tool, this time designed to [create modular grids](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/layoutlove/modular.html).

This new Modular grid generator lets you choose the number of columns and rows you need for your modular grid. You can also specify the column and row gaps in px, em, rem, and % units. Lastly, you can choose from a selection of common aspect ratios for your modules.

An automatic preview of your grid also includes column and row position values. You can download a WebP image of the generated grid.

You can also copy the HTML and CSS code to your clipboard.

But there’s more. Press on any of the modules to open a modal where you can choose how many columns or rows a module can span.

This lets you easily create a variety of layouts from your modular grid.

And, if you’re the Tailwind sort, you can copy code for that framework too.

Finally, I also added Tailwind to the export options in my Compound grid generator, to keep the functionality of my layout generators in sync.
