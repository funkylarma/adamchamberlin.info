As endurance athletes, we know that recovery is just as important as training. After a hard ride or workout, your body craves the right nutrients to replenish glycogen, repair muscles, and prepare for the next session. That’s where a recovery smoothie like is beneficial because it is a perfect blend of carbs, protein, and healthy fats to fuel your performance and recovery.

Why Recovery Nutrition Matters
------------------------------

After a workout, your body is in a state of repair. To maximize recovery:

-   Carbs replenish glycogen stores.
-   Protein repairs muscle damage and supports adaptation.
-   Healthy fats and micronutrients aid overall recovery and health.

This smoothie is designed to hit the ideal 3:1 carb-to-protein ratio, making it a powerhouse for recovery (1).

The Recipe

Here’s what you’ll need:

-   1 handful of spinach (1 cup raw)
-   1 banana
-   3/4 cup blueberries
-   1 tbsp almond butter
-   1 scoop Vega protein powder
-   20 oz oat milk
-   Pinch of sea salt

-   Calories: ~500-550
-   Carbs: 85g

This smoothie provides the perfect balance of macronutrients to refuel your body and keep you energized for the rest of the day.
