**[Fizik Vento Powerstrap Aeroweave](https://www.fizik.com/us_en/vento-powerstrap-aeroweave.html):** In a sea of white cycling shoes with BOA dials, the Fizik Vento Powerstrap Aeroweave is the way to stand out in the crowd … especially the pink/orange colorway. And don’t let the velcro straps fool you. They may be old school tech, but these are shoes worn at the World Tour pro level. So they’re more than up for the task.

**According to Fizik:** With its innovative second-generation Aeroweave upper, Powerstrap Aeroweave is a straight up racing shoe: the lightest and most breathable in the range, built with a high-tenacity net-like structure coupled with our stiffest carbon outsole.

A lightweight, ultra-breathable road cycling shoe built from an innovative, net-like material paired with a full-carbon outsole for unrivaled ventilation and race-ready responsiveness.

-   Weight: 184 g
-   Sizes: 36-48 (37 to 47 also in half sizes)

**Chuck Peña PEZ sez:** You may have seen these shoes on Movistar team riders over the past couple of seasons. So even though they are old school with velcro for the closure, they are definitely pro level.

You could get the [Movistar Team edition](https://www.fizik.com/us_en/vento-powerstrap-aeroweave-movistar-team.html), but PEZ went with the #realmenwearpink version. Because … pink … the color of the Giro … my favorite of the Grand Tours.

The pink with orange colorway aside, two things stand out about the Fizik Vento Powerstrap Aeroweave.

First is the velcro straps. They’re old school tech, but they don’t work like velcro closures of old that pulled the two sides of the shoe (vamps) together across the tongue. Instead the front Powerstrap (to adjust midfoot) is a zig-zag pattern that creates more of a “wrap around” effect. Along with the rear Powerstrap (that just comes across the instep), they are supposed to provide a very secure fit. Just trying the shoes on for fit, I can say that the velcro Powerstrap system provided a secure and comfortable fit around my feet, _i.e._, as locked in as my shoes with BOA dials — with no pressure points or hot spots. (But a very different feel from the Fizik R3 shoes with sailcloth velcro straps that David Millar wore towards the end of his career and were also favorites of mine before I abandoned velcro in favor of BOA.) I’ll be interested to see how they hold up to extended riding.

_Back to the future with velcro_

The second thing is the material for the upper. Instead of a more “solid” material (synthetic or leather), it’s a vented mesh fabric. Needless to say, the Fizik Vento Powerstrap Aeroweave are shoes intended for hot weather riding. The Aeroweave is in its second generation and according to Fizik, the _woven fabric interlaces nylon fibers with filaments of thermoplastic polymers for an even lighter shoe that doesn’t lose its original tenacity, providing the strength and support required in competition_. Again, just trying the shoes on for fit (size-wise, I’m a US 9 which is 42 EU according to the Fizik size guide and that’s what fit my feet), the Aeroweave material conformed to my foot shape not unlike a synthetic or leather upper, _i.e._, it was a “firm” but comfortable fit. I had enough room in the toe box that my toes weren’t being squished together.

_The Aeroweave mesh material is apparent when viewed from the inside. Also note the two intake vents in the forefoot._

The rest of the shoe is relatively “conventional” and what you would expect in a high-level shoe that pros ride.

The sole is unidirectional carbon fiber. Fizik claims a stiffness index of 10, but it’s important to know that there is no standard for measuring stiffness. That said, given my experience with several different pairs of Fizik shoes (most recently, the [Fizik Tempo Decos Carbon Iridescent](https://pezcyclingnews.com/technspec/review-fizik-tempo-decos-carbon-iridescent-road-shoes/) road shoes), I’m more than sure they’re plenty stiff. Again, these are shoes ridden by pro riders so if they’re good enough for them, they’re probably good enough for us mere mortals.

_Black carbon fiber goodness_

Speaking of the sole, it has a standard 3-hole LOOK cleat mount (if you’re like me and ride Speedplay pedals, you’ll need an adapter plate). Plus there are two front intake vents for air flow/cooling (but no exit ports).

_Toe and heel pads for walking about, but they’re not replaceable_

_The insoles have a metatarsal pad that can provide #marginalgains comfort_

It’s not even spring yet, but we’re already getting days in the 70s(F) here in the Lowcountry. So it won’t be too long before it actually gets hot. As the Fizik Vento Powerstrap Aeroweave shoes are hot weather shoes, I’ll get the chance to see how they do in their intended environment and report back. Stay tuned!
