Are you trying to decide whether to ride flat bars or drop bars? Keegan tells you if you should...and hint, you probably shouldnt.

Keegan and Alexey spent a couple days riding together in Leadville on the 100 MTB course and thought, why not sit down for a chat before the race! Come check out our pre Leadville thoughts including course, equipment, nutrition and altitude.

Feel free to ask questions in the comments for the post race episode!
