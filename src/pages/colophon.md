This site is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and hosted on [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/).

11ty is a static site generator and most of the content is contained within plain Markdown documents which are processed into finished HTML for you to view.

The full source code can be found over on [GitHub](https://github.com/funkylarma/adamchamberlin.info)

In 2005, when I first put a personal domain out on the internet it was using WordPress and resolved to shibbyonline.co.uk

Over the following years I created content and the site was hosted on Dreamhost.

As family and life developed, the site was neglected and to cut out hosting, I migrated the content over to Tumblr.

2023 saw me decide to take back my data, and so I exported all my legacy posts into Markdown documents and stored them locally with a plan to host them again, some day.

adamchamberlin.info was put into place in 2024 and all the original content was redirected to the new domain name. Google Search Console helped migrate any search index results.
