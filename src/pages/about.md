Welcome to my online playground and sandbox of ideas and musings.{.h3}

I am the head of development at [Mackman Group][1] and have been tinkering with computers for longer than I can remember.

This site has been in development since 2008 and has seen many versions and setups. Currently, it is built with [11ty][2] and hosted over at [Netlify][3].
