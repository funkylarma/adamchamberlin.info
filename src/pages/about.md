Welcome to my online playground and sandbox of ideas and musings.

I am the head of development at Mackman Group and have been tinkering with computers for longer than I can remember.

This site has been in development since 2008 and has seen many different versions and setups. Currently we are using WordPress and a bespoke theme via the Oxygen Page Builder.
