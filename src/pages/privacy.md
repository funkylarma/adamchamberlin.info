## Cookies

### There are no cookies between friends

In my day job I work with many clients who wish to track and monitor their site visits and engagement so I understand the need for cookies and tracking platforms.

I have no need for any of that, my life will not change if you view an Amazon listing after viewing my site and I do not get paid by the view. So I do not track or plan to track any of your visits.

## Embedded content from other websites

Content I write on site may include embedded data such as videos, images, articles, etc. Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if you had visited the site yourself.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, this is completely down to your own settings and accounts with those sites. I do not store or track any of that.

## Browser Based Local Storage

Currently I do not store anything within your browser outside of the usual browser caching process. There is a plan in the future where I will allow you to control some settings on the site such as theme appearance but this is a long way off.
