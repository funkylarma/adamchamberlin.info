Welcome to my online playground and sandbox of ideas and musings.{.h3}

I'm the head of development at [Mackman Group](https://mackman.co.uk), but my journey to this keyboard has taken some interesting detours through bike shops, race courses, and ultra marathon trails.

## The Short Version
I grew up on a farm in rural England, learned to fix things before I could drive them, and have been tinkering with computers for longer than I can remember. These days I split my time between writing code, [riding bikes](/cycling/), and occasionally [running](/running/) very long distances.

## The Web Development Path
I've been building things on the web since this site first went live in 2008. What started as curiosity turned into a career, and I've seen this site through many versions and setups over the years—each iteration reflecting where I was technically and personally at the time.

Currently, I lead development at Mackman Group, but my relationship with web technology has been anything but linear. In 2016, I left the tech industry entirely to pursue a career in cycling.

## The Cycling Detour
After my first child was born, I started commuting 20km to work on a hybrid bike. That humble commute sparked something, and within a year I was racing and had qualified as a British Cycling coach.

By 2016, I'd made the jump to work as head [mechanic](/mechanic/) at a local bike shop specialising in Italian brands. Over five years, I was trained in Cytech standards, learned to build custom wheels, and had experiences I never imagined—riding with Miguel Induráin, meeting Fausto Pinarello himself, and even dismantling Team Sky's grand tour-winning bikes.

I also built and coached a [small development team](https://www.instagram.com/tph_racing/), helping young riders from local clubs get the team experience and support they needed.

The pandemic brought me back to web development, but cycling remains central to my life. I race across multiple disciplines—road, cyclocross, criteriums, time trials, gran fondos, and most recently gravel. I represented GB at the Masters Cyclocross World Championships and qualified for the UCI Gran Fondo World Championships in 2021.

## The Running Chapter
During Covid lockdown, I started running to keep my partner Lucy company on 5K loops. When racing returned, I somehow went from casual 5Ks to completing 100km ultras on the Stour Valley Path (twice), the Suffolk Coastal 50km (twice), and around the Jurassic Coast. I even completed a marathon a month for an entire year.
These days, running serves mainly as cross-training for cycling, building durability and resilience that translates well to the bike.

## The Technical Foundation
Growing up on a small independent farm, my dad brought me up with a strong sense of technical understanding. Rebuilding farming equipment taught me to visualize how things work and identify areas of concern—skills that apply equally whether I'm debugging code, diagnosing a shifting issue, or pacing an ultra marathon.

## Now
This site has been in development since 2008 and continues to evolve. It's part portfolio, part blog, part personal wiki—a place to document projects, share knowledge, and explore ideas at the intersection of technology, cycling, and endurance sports.

Thanks for stopping by.
