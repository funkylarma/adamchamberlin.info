One foot in front of the other{.h3}

Running came into my life during the Covid-19 pandemic. With races cancelled and the world locked down, I started running simply to keep my partner Lucy company on her 5K loops. What began as companionship turned into something more.

At first, it was just those simple 5Ks. Then we expanded to 10K. The rhythm of putting one foot in front of the other, the simplicity of it compared to the mechanical complexity of cycling—there was something refreshingly pure about it.

## Ultra Running
When racing returned, I went full bore. But instead of returning to the road, I discovered trail ultra running. The long distances, the self-sufficiency, the mental game of keeping moving for hours on end—it turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.

### Stour Valley Path 100km

I've completed this beast twice. One hundred kilometres following the River Stour through Suffolk and Essex. It's a journey of endurance, navigation, and mental fortitude.

### Suffolk Coastal 50km

Another local ultra that I've tackled twice. Fifty kilometres along the stunning Suffolk coastline, battling the elements and the distance.

### Jurassic Coast 100km

One hundred kilometres around one of England's most spectacular coastlines. The Jurassic Coast Ultra tested everything—legs, mind, and determination.

## Marathon a Month

Perhaps my most ambitious project: completing a marathon every month for an entire year. Twelve marathons, twelve months, each one a different challenge. Some were organized events, others were solo efforts mapped out on local trails and roads.

It taught me consistency, resilience, and respect for the distance. Each month brought different weather, different fitness levels, and different mental states—but the commitment remained the same.

## Back to Cycling

These days, running has taken on a different role. My focus has shifted back to cycling, and running now serves primarily as a way to add durability and cross-training to my cycling fitness. The long miles on foot have built a resilience that translates well to the bike.

If I do race on foot, it'll be trail runs—the technical terrain and natural settings still hold an appeal. But the bars have called me back, and running has become the supporting act rather than the main show.

What started as keeping Lucy company on lockdown runs gave me years of incredible experiences and challenges. Those ultra marathons taught me about endurance, mental toughness, and what the body can achieve when pushed. Now, that knowledge serves me well back in the saddle.
