Over the years, I have had various contact forms and social networking handles, all I have learnt is that they serve to generate more email or internet mental chatter.{.h3}

To keep me focused and the noise to a minimum, I have cut back on my digital footprint, I’m sure there are still numerous nodes out there that still link to my go-to handle; [funkylarma](https://www.google.com/search?q=funkylarma). These days I’m not that active, but you can find me occasionally online on the following.
