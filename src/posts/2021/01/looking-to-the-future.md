It is hard to believe it has only been a year. So much has changed and yet so little at the same time. The New Year is the time that many sit and make resolutions and plan improvement for the coming year. Maybe it is time to reframe our thoughts and look at it differently this time around.

This time twelve months ago the first sightings of COVID-19 were appearing and it started changing the world, completely. There was a problem that affected everyone, we all had to start working together to fight an unseen foe. You see that is the thing about a global pandemic, it does not matter about your skin colour or your financial demographic, we are all in it together.

So now as we enter 2021 we can do all we want to put 2020 behind us but January the 1st is just another day. Don’t get wrong we should all celebrate and plan for the new year but the world won’t be fixed with one more sun rise.

If we truly want to make 2021 better we must learn from 2020 and your resolutions might not involve a gym membership or a new diet.

There might be vaccines in the works, there are talks to build new trade agreements with new markets, but one thing remains the same, the humans behind ever turn.

So my plan is not to put a magic fix on a resolution but to make the most of what I have. By being the best human I can and with a positive attitude I can make 2021 better. So I encourage you to do the same. Reframe your views on resolutions and make the most of what you already have. Be the best you can. Don’t judge those who think different or have a different outlook. We are all in the same boat and it is time to start bailing it out together.
