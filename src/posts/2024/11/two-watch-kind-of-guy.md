For many years now I have been an Apple Watch wearer and honestly I can’t see myself moving away from it any time soon. The ability to remain connected and interact with my phone but not actually use my phone is amazing.
It also serves as a training tool with the right apps and settings. With a combination of watchOS 7 and Autosleep I use the watch to run a wind down routine in the evening and track my sleep. Then using HealthFit I can push this data into TrainingPeaks
