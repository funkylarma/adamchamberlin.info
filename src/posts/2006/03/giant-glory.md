[![Giant Glory](/images/119490169_84114fb34d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/119490169/ "Photo Sharing")Reading through the news I came across [this](http://www.bikemagic.com/news/article.asp?UAN=4680&v=1) article from [BikeMagic](http://www.bikemagic.com/) about the new Giant Glory downhill machine. For one it is a stunning colour and the components are pretty nifty, but just look at [this](http://www.bikemagic.com/news/images/giant06_glory_link_hi.jpg) picture of the gusset work and link detail. I used to ride a Box One many moons ago and this just takes me back.
