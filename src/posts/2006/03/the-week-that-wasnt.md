The last week I have been away with the fairies, in more ways than it sounds. My head has not been with it and I’ve forgotten how to commuicate in a known language. To which sorry to any one who has tried to contact me or expected me to do something and I never showed or replied.

Now on this clearer Monday morning I have had the time to reflect, or rather the common sense to remove my head from my ass and realise my mistakes.

Sunday was Lucy’s birthday, which happy birthday, hope you enjoyed it and the present is on the way!  
British summer time also kicked in over the week end, which is long over due. Why we have to have this strange set up I don’t know but the evenings are now longer and brighter, hopefully this will be the beginning of a better start.
