I spent most of the afternoon in Rob’s shop the other day, well I was bored, and whilst I walked around I found my next bike. It was a [Electra](https://www.electrabike.com/) Ghost Rider, a slung back cruiser.

Normally I would pass this off as a no point machine but I just could not pass up a test ride. Within 10 meters you could not help it, I fell in love with the bike. Even pedaling just created a smooth motion that was just amazing. The Nexus three speed hub gears made easy going and this is quite simpily a bike to relax on. After looking through the catalogue I noticed the ’[Hellbilly](https://www.electrabike.com/europe_new/04/bikes/06bikes/streamride/06_str_20.html)’ version which in a candy red scheme looked more pimpy and would be my bike of choice.

Once the summer comes I could see myself spending a lot of time just cruising around the place.
