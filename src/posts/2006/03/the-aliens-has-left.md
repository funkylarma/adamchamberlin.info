It looks like the coolest and quite possibly the only PC I would invest in has been [sold to Dell](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/dell-buys-alienware-162317.php).  
Please, please, please do not mess with the recipe Dell, Alienware machineâ€™s are in a class of their own, keep your black budget boxes away from them!
