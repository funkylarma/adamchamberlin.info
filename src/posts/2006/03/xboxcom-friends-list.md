I logged into xbox.com last night just to check out what games were being delayed this week and noticed a cool little addition to the friends list. The gamerscore.

No more do you have to view your friend's profile to see their score, it is displayed right next to the name in the list. Handy if you have one of those gamerscore/penis insecurity things going on and feel the need to have the largest.
