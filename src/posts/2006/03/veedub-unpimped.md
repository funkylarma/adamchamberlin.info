I know this has been mentioned once [already](https://binarybonsai.com/) if not [before](https://oneighturbo.com/?p=202) but when Sean popped into the office this morning I spoke about [these adverts](https://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/02/22/vw-strikes-again-un-pimp-my-ride-videos/) from VW.
He had not seen them, so I said I would post a link for him to find quickly, well, he is a welder by trade!
