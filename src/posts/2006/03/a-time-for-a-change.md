This morning I recieved a set of Time RXE pedals.

To be honest I’ve never really spent a lot on pedals since I could ride a bike. The last ones I got for my road bike were a set of Shimano 105 SPD-SL’s which so far have racked up over 1,000 miles. Last week end one of the pedals started making a horrible noise; the noise that says I’m gonnna die soon.

So I started looking around for a new set of pedals and was looking into the whole float issue. I have some strange things going on in my knees and lately I’ve been getting some nasty pains towards the back of my knee. To which I read a review to say that Time and Speedplay are some of the best out there for people with knee problems.  
Being the tight wad that I am I did not want to spend out a fortune on trying a pedal out to see if it helps, yet I wanted something in a hurry to test this week end. Which meant I had to make an internet purchase; sorry Rob I would have come to you if I could!

I’m not expecting the world as I refused to fork out 150 notes for the carbon and ti version but so far the only good side is the cleat look a bit more manly than the Shimano’s.  
Any one else had experience with Time pedals?
