I’ve not been about much, the new theme has been put on hold, Lucy wonders where I am going and what happened to me. The answer is Ghost Recon.

This game is just about as good as it gets for the new 360. Finally a game that makes you feel like ‘next gen’. We were playing a bit of defend last night when I noticed that the empty shells from my MG21 were ejecting from the gun, hitting the wall, bouncing around a bit and then piling up next to me. How much time and effort went into the game to think of the details like this.
Sorry for the poor image, I don’t think camera phones were designed to photograph televisions.
