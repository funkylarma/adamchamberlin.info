I was hoping for a nice quiet day at work; following up some leads and looking into some more asbestos rules and regulations, however a phone call from OZ meant Iâ€™m spending the day coding the [company](http://www.oscarproducts.com) web site.

Just what I need after spending my spare working this site. I need a break, I just nested a div tag within an a tag; what was I thinking!
