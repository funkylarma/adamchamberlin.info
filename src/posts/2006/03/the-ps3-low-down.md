The last few weeks have been ripe with news of the PS3 launch date so here are some details just in case you were a bit confused:

It will be launched in November this year; yep 2006. 
They are planning a Worldwide launch; good luck!  
6 million units in the first year; financial year or our standard 12 months.  
60gb Hard drive included; good move.  
Backwards compatible with all Playstation games; Well done Sony  
Full Blu Ray supprt; No HD-DVD?  
HD and HDMI ready; Thanks, now I have to get the matching TV  
Linux OS installed; interesting.  
Region Free Games; Is that a good thing?  
Free Online Service; So EA will sting me instead?

Of course there are a lot more details out there so just Google for yourself but the best news for me is they have ditched the ‘boomerang’ controller!  
This was a major let down but thankfully it was just a prototype and the new controller would be revealed at E3. 
The online service that Sony claimed would be the [Xbox Live killer](http://www.shibbyonline.co.uk/2006/02/01/playstation-live/) is rumoured to called 'PlayStation Network Platform’ will be ready to support the machine from launch. If this service remains free is uncertain, as are a lot of details about the whole situation.

Of course as with a lot of Sony hype it might just be that; hype. Expect delays and set backs right up till Christmas, that said I am looking forward to some next gen Gran Turismo.
