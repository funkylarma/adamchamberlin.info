Unless you have had your head in the sand for a few days you are probably aware of the name change to the new Nintendo console.  
The old name; Revolution, is out and up steps; Wii.  
Nope you read right, Wii.  
It is pronouced _we_ rather _wie_ and there are some good [reasons][1] behind it.  
David B has a good [post][2] going on over at [davidbabylon.com][3] which details a lot of links regarding this change, also the promo video for the event. Worth a look
