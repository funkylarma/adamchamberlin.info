Last night was a fun filled little gem, I was talked into attending a networking for networks seminar, or something like that.  
To be honest I always thought networking was a peice of CAT5 cable, turns out networking is also talking to other people about they could not really care less about!  
What a strange evening, 40 odd people all doing the business card shuffle and presenting themselves and their business’. Me; I just stood there with my Bullshit Bingo sheet and crossed off all the key words. I’ve never heard ‘total cost of ownership’ mentioned so much!
