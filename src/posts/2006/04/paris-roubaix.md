Lucy recorded the Paris-Roubaix cycle race for me today as I was; as usual out on my bike.

What a race it turned out to be, World Champion and favorite for the win, Tom Boonen, was not on top form and let Fabien Cancellara of CSC slip away at the end to take victory. But for me the biggest let down of the race was to see Big George Hincapie take a tumble and really knock himself up. Looking at the replay it looked like the steerer tube sheared off and he was left with no steering or brakes, of course this happened on the cobbles so he took a flyer into the verge and just sat there in pain, suspected shoulder problems.
