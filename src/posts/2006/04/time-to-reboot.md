A lot of sites I visit have changed their looks recently and it might have something to do with the upcoming [Spring Reboot](https://www.cssreboot.com/), or it’s just a popular time to code!

I did think about entering the Reboot a while back, when I first started working on my [new theme](https://www.shibbyonline.co.uk/2006/02/25/a-theme-is-born/). But at the time I sat there thinking my new look will be finished way before the May 1st deadline, so I went against my first plan. How wrong was I.  
Here we are entering April and I’m still not finished so I went back on my words and decided to sign up. Hopefully this will give me motivation I need to finally finish off the work I started. In honestly there is not a lot left to do, just the menu bar, comment section and some visual tweeks but as usual time is a gift I’m not blessed with.
