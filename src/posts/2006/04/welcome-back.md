It has taken a while to sit down and write this post, but we are back from a extended holiday weekend on the north Norfolk coast.

We were camping in a small village called East Runton, which is just outside Cromer.

Mental note if anyone ever mentions the idea of camping on an Easter weekend, tell them where to go; itâ€™s bloody cold!
