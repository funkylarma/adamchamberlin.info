I was not aware of this but my Xbox360 actually [blogs][1]! If you are connected to the internet (most 360 gamers are due to the Live service offered my Microsoft) then every time you fire up your machine it records what you are doing. This information is obviously handy for keeping your gamer profile updated but the people over at [360Voice][2] have come up with another use; getting you Xbox to write a blog. Whilst it can be interesting to read and keep a track of those achievements it is a bit concerning in a Big Brother sort of way!
