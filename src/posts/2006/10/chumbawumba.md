We all know the age old theory; give enough monkies enough typewriters and eventually they will write the complete works of Shakespear.

Well I guess it could be the same for current day, give enough users enough html editiors and eventually they will create a valid web page.  
Dan is proving the point over at [Satansden](http://www.satansden.co.uk), well done and keep it up.
