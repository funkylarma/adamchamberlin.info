Congratulations to Ant and Charlotte; Oscar John Fredrick Duckmanton was born this morning at 4:16. He tipped the scales at 6lb 3oz and every one is doing well.

Well done both and welcome to the world Oscar. Once you all get home and settled Lucy and I will make a visit; until then take care.

I never thought I would use the ‘newborn’ tag in Flickr!
