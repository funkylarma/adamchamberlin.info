Sitting at work this morning when an envelope made itâ€™s way to my desk; a letter from Mike and Debbie at Willow Tree Farm Shop donating money towards the British Heart Foundation upon completion of my trip. Given the generosity of the donation I felt compelled to mention them personally. Thank you both very much and I wish you all the best. On a side note if you are in the Cavendish/Glemsford area and require fresh vegetables and Farm produce please drop by and give them a look in.
