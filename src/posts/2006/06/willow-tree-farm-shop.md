Sitting at work this morning when an envelope made its way to my desk; a letter from Mike and Debbie at Willow Tree Farm Shop, donating money towards the British Heart Foundation upon completion of my trip. Given the generosity of the donation, I felt compelled to mention them personally. Thank you, both very much, and I wish you all the best. On a side note, if you are in the Cavendish/Glemsford area and require fresh vegetables and farm produce, please drop by and give them a look in.
