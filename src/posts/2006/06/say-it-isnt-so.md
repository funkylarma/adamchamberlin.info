This morning I took a quick trip to the doctors. I’ve been suffering from a few aches and pains since the ride and thought it best have a quick check up. The main concern was a knee problem that stems from an old basketball injury. But it also turned out I have [tendonitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendonitis "Tendonitis") in my ankles! The correction for both the knee and ankle problem is one which is so severe that I can hardly type it: _**Don’t ride!**_ This is going to be difficult to do, but when he explained that if the knee does not clear up with rest and medication they will resort to injecting steroids into my knee to kick start the joint. Put like that spending some time in the garden instead of the saddle looks fine with me.
