Yesterday was the [longest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Solstice) day in th UK, whilst it does mean that there was the maximum amount of daylight it also means that it is all downhill from here on out. The nights will be drawing in, the days colder and nights darker. I’ve still not fired up the BBQ yet this year and it’s the end of June.
