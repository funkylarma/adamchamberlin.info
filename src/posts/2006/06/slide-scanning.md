I purchased my Epson RX500 over a year ago, still not sure why but at the time it looked the part. I think I needed the scanner part more than the printer but it turned out I never really used it. Last night Serena came round with some photoâ€™s from the trip, the missing ones with us crossing the finish line, but these were in 35mm format! I remembered that the Epson had a facility for scanning negatives, which turns out to be really clever. You load the negative into a holder and the scanner has a special light in the hood to expose the negative to the scanner element. The software (which IS Mac compatible) then transforms the negative to a colour photo, giving you the option to decide on the final size. The only downside; the speed, if you want large version is really does drag along; around 10minutes for a set of 4 negatives.
