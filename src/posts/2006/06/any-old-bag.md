[![Any Old Bag](/images/157940455_e993055140_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/157940455/ "Any Old Bag")Yesterday was a good day work wise. I have been set with the task of creating a new web site for work. The way in which we work has shifted, due to unstable oil prices and the doom gloom out on the British high street people are not responding to our standard sales. But the internet and in particular ebay are proving to be a massive source of leads. To which we have created [Any Old Bag](http://www.anyoldbag.com), this will be the front of a online “quick bags for quick fixes” style shop. I’m going to have lots of time next week to come up with the layout and style but until then your stuck with the crumbs.
