[![Oscar](/images/174406863_02565b3668_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/174406863/ "Oscar")Saturday Lucy and I went for a trip back to her home town; Stamford to see Ant and Charlotte and new born Oscar.Of course the big part of the trip was to see Oscar and do the usual ’_ohhhhhh_’ ’_ahhhhhhh_’ and other cute noises. But whilst we were there is was also the annual fete for Stamford. So Ant and I tried to work out the pushchair and decide what attachments would be required and set off down to the floats and turn out.
