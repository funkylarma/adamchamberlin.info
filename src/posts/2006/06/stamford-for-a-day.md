Saturday Lucy and I went for a trip back to her home town; Stamford to see Ant and Charlotte and new born Oscar.Of course the big part of the trip was to see Oscar and do the usual ’\_ohhhhhh\_’ ’\_ahhhhhhh\_’ and other cute noises. But whilst we were there is was also the annual fete for Stamford. So Ant and I tried to work out the pushchair and decide what attachments would be required and set off down to the floats and turn out.

On our return we opted to fire up the BBQ and burn some meat, whilst watching the flesh slowly turn into carbon there was a rumble in the air; all of a sudden a Lancaster bomber did a low level pass of the house, luckily I had my camera with me at the time.
