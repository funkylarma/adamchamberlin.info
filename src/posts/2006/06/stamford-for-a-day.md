Saturday, Lucy and I went for a trip back to her home town; Stamford, to see Ant and Charlotte and newborn Oscar. Of course, the big part of the trip was to see Oscar and do the usual ’\_ohhhhhh\_’ ’\_ahhhhhhh\_’ and other cute noises. But whilst we were there is also the annual fête for Stamford. So Ant and I tried to work out the pushchair and decide what attachments would be required and set off down to the floats and turn out.

On our return, we opted to fire up the BBQ and burn some meat, whilst watching the flesh slowly turn into carbon, there was a rumble in the air; all of a sudden, a Lancaster bomber did a low-level pass of the house, luckily I had my camera with me at the time.
