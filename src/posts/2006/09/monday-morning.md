When I opened the curtains the weather was less than perfect, it looked like the first fog for a while. Yet little did I know what today had in store. On the ride into work the skies were clearing up and things looked a bit brighter. At work I remembered the deal, two big deliveries were moved to Monday morning, no escaping it I was stuck in the warehouse. Then Rob calls, desperate to get hold of me he pops in. Are you busy he asks? Yes sort of, whats the deal? Well I got to go and see the release of a lot of 2007 gear if you fancy the drive? The event is the press release for Scott, held in [Basildon Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basildon_Park) it was going to host all the latest gear ready for production next year. Can you believe it, next week Iâ€™m off work and nothing to do. This week, the one day I can not get out of turns out to be the only day this event is on.
