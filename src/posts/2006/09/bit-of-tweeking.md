You may notice a couple of changes around here. I’ve been working on a few different ideas for the metadata. The main one being the photo album page. For many month’s I’ve used the WordPress [FAlbum][1] plugin for displaying photographs from my Flickr account. However I found this a bit bloated, it adds lots of code and calls on the server from within WordPress. I wanted to find a simpler approach to the problem and stumbled upon [Brett Driscoll][2]’s [Cruiser][3] app. Cruiser is a standalone web interface for accessing Flickr accounts. It uses phpFlickr which should have been my first port of call but as Brett has done such a good job with the rest of Cruiser why not adapt his work. So far I have installed Cruiser and I’m in the process of modifying the styles to suit the metadata. There are few modifications I want to make and bit of code adjustment to get it how I really want but in general not a bad bit of work there Brett!
