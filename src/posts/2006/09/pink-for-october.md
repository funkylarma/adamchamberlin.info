[shibbyonline][1] will be taking a lighter shade of red for the month of October. In support of [National Breast Cancer Awareness Month][2] this site will be sporting a pink hue in an effort to try and raise support and knowledge for this disease. Whilst I have not been affected directly by this, a very fond co-worker contracted breast cancer and subsequently passed away. If you wish to find out more information or also show your support please drop by Matthew Oliphantâ€™s [Pink For October][3] web metadata.
