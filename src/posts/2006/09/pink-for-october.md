[shibbyonline](https://www.shibbyonline.co.uk "shibbyonline") will be taking a lighter shade of red for the month of October. In support of [National Breast Cancer Awareness Month](https://nbcam.org/ "N.B.C.A.M.") this site will be sporting a pink hue in an effort to try and raise support and knowledge for this disease. Whilst I have not been affected directly by this, a very fond co-worker contracted breast cancer and subsequently passed away. If you wish to find out more information or also show your support please drop by Matthew Oliphantâ€™s [Pink For October](https://www.pinkforoctober.org "Pink For October") web metadata.
