It was a year ago to the day that a group of ex Grabor employees all met together at the Boat House in Sudbury. So what better way to mark a year on but to organise another meeting. I was not certain what to expect, not really sure what a lot of the ex workers were doing with themselves these days. Added to the fact I was not feeling too hot I actually wanted to pass on the day. Regardless Lucy and I went along to find the usual crowd of workers and managers sitting there all asking the same questions: “so what are you doing now?”, “how is life treating you?”, “do you know what happened to so'n'so?” It was good to see a few of the old faces and see how every one else is doing, would have been nice if a few more white coats made the effort. Don’t you always find that if you start drinking at 3 o'clock in the afternoon it is very difficult to stop. Eventually you end up sitting there over a vodka thinking about food but knowing you can’t really stomach it! Yet when you have a cook like Dan to the rescue, chili squid has never tasted so good.

This was going to be Acton’s take on Glastonbury with ctrl.alt.delete, Black Marriah and some sets from London based jockeys providing the backdrop.
