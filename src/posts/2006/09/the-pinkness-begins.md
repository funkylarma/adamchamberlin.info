With only a couple of days left in September I have been quietly trying to construct my pink theme for [shibbyonline](https://wadamchamberlin.info).

[Natalie](https://nataliejost.com/blog/early-for-october) has already set the mood, a very nice version of her site; not as pink as thought it would be, but the message is obvious.
I have been keeping an eye on the ever-growing list of sites over at [Pink For October](https://pinkforoctober.org) and so far, I’m really looking forward to seeing people’s own version’s and take on the pink themes.
