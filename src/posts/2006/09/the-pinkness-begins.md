With only a couple of days left in September I have been quietly trying to construct my pink theme for [shibbyonline][1].

[Natalie][2] has already set the mood, a very nice version of her site; not as pink as thought it would be but the message is very clear.
I have been keeping an eye on the ever growing list of sites over at [Pink For October][3] and so far I’m really looking forward to seeing people’s own version’s and take on the pink themes.
