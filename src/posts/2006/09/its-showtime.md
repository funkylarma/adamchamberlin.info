Apple will be holding another event entitled ‘It’s Showtime’ This can only indicate a media orientated spin on things, rumors are flying around like mad and are describing things like new iPods; possible video, new Nano’s, an iPhone, media related iMac news and all of the like. I think it is about time I updated my battered and beaten 4th Gen iPod let's just wait and see what is released.
