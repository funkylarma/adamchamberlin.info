Today is the [Autumn reboot][1]. Sites from around the world will release there new look, hopefully completely standard compliant, with a view to gain interest and a better view of their sites. I’m gutted that this time around I have just not had the time to take part. I had every intention to have another go at the reboot but due to work load and changes in job I’ve been totally snowed under; well I’m still sporting the Pink for October theme. The whole reboot scheme has actually changed since the Spring version and to be honest it does not appear to have that same level of input and respect of previous incarnations; to demonstrate long standing reboot successor [Matt Brett][2] is not on the [list][3], in fact none of the big names in standards and designs appear to be there. That said congratulations to every one that took part.
