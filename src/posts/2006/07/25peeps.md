I’m on [25peeps.com][1]. It was so long ago I filled in the form I forgot all about the site! I think I followed a link there from Derek at [5ThirtyOne][2], I completed the form and then waited. The site itself looks quite good and the idea behind it is of course another one of those simple, wish you thought of it, style. The only downside is that unfortunately sex sells, look at the highest ranking ‘peeps’ but then come on be honest did you not click on the cleavage only to find out is was some blokes back! If you are going to join the [25peeps.com][3] community you best off pick a really clever image, think long and hard about what best describes you, you need something that ties up all the different aspects of your online persona. If in doubt just use a picture of a woman in her pants!
