This morning I went over to LifecycleUK to see Rob, I was not on a mission to spend more money on my bike in fact, I was selling him some carrier bags! But whilst I was there, Rob called me into the back so show me something special, that is a bmc TT01 Time Trial frame. You will see one under Flloyd Landis tomorrow in the Tour de France prologue. Apparently, that frame is the only one in the UK and is number 16 in the world! Once built up, this machine is heading off to the states where we hope it will be ridden in anger. If only I could afford the Â£6k price tag would I then worry about what wheels to put on it!
