[![](/images/191493691_ec30c23a00_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/70011121@N00/191493691 "3k") Thats right, after a ride out in the sun yesterday my bike computer now reads 3,000 miles. Thats 3,000 miles in just under a year, not a record but not bad going for me. BTW That does not include the 800 odd miles Iâ€™ve done on my Marin.
