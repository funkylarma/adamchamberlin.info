Iâ€™ve been using Flickr for a while now, the other month it went Gamma which was great as the whole UI is a lot better. But using it the other day I noticed something which got me thinking. When you upload a photo and then go to view it to link it or insert it into your blog you are given two options; the code for a link and then the url to the image, how many people noticed the text beneath it:

> **Remember!** Flickr Terms of Service specify that if you post a Flickr photo on an external website, the photo must link back to its photo page. (So, use Option 1.)

By my knowledge that means that every photo you use on your blog must be a link back to Flickr. Not bad you think but what about all the uses of lightbox, thickbox, ibox, litebox, anymorebox, etc.. out there. Or better yet why is the url to the static image even available?
