[![](/images/180062180_8596ea29e5_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/70011121@N00/180062180 "IMG_3240.JPG")Today saw the last day of work for Colin Frost at Oscar Products. Tomorrow he and Linda will be catching a plane and setting up a new life in Portugal. It was a bit sereal to see him drive away knowing that he was not just popping out for a _sarnie_. Colin was here when I started at Oscar and has helped me out no end. I’ve never really been in the whole friendly work environment before but in a small company you all seem to just get along, I would like to think that we got along alright and had a good laugh. I will miss ‘Victor’ and his miserable outlook on life, but then he was always under a lot of stress. I wish them both the best of luck and remember if you ever have a problem with that bluetooth thing I’m more than happy to pop on over and sort it out. All the best.
