I was going through some feeds earlier and notice a few interesting cycling related articles.
RoadCyclingUK had their first [look](https://www.roadcyclinguk.com/news/article.asp?UAN=1291&v=1) at the new [Look 565](https://static.flickr.com/45/144526262_8d94415fde_o.jpg) frame and fork. I was lucky enough to ride Dave’s 386 486 Look the other month and what a bike, but for me the money has to be on a tubular frame; think I’ve found a future frameset. Oakley are breaking into the [hydration market](https://www.bikemagic.com/news/article.asp?UAN=4797&v=1). This is not a contender for my [Camelback Havoc](https://adamchamberlin.info/2005/04/18/just-like-a-camel/), not at £70 for the bag alone, but being an Oakley freak I can see me looking at this for general use.

Finally Magura have released details on next years [brakes](https://www.bikemagic.com/news/article.asp?UAN=4791&v=1). I’ve had a set of HS33’s for about 7 years and they have never failed or leaked, I think when my [Mono’s](https://static.flickr.com/22/27841563_ab2c280fad.jpg) show signs of age I’ll go for a set of Marta’s.
