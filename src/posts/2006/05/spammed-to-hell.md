Over the week end my site has been hit my a massive spam offensive.  
My defenses against spam are not the greatest, if you have more than one link in your comment you get moderated. Apart from that I rely on the gods of online Casino’s to shine on me to protect my metadata.  
This current wave is a clever one and not relying on a link in the comment section but rather the link to online viagra stores are in the author’s name.  
That said the comments about great my site is and how it has been bookmarked is always good to hear, even if they are auto generated.
