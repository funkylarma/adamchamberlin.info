I knew that Lyn was out of the office today, which meant I was going to pretty much be on my own. That was until I got into work. Meet my new work [colleague](http://static.flickr.com/51/149325370_d413e807f9.jpg), as much fun as he was I had to let him go, he was just not work material, he kept on going on about his family and was not really focused enough for my liking.
