According to [Mint][1] 50.9% of the visitors to my site use Internet Explorer (shame on you, [browse happy][2]!) needless to say you must cater for all users really and 50% is something you just cannot ignore.

![IE you pain!][image-1]

Chris brought to my attention that the site is not IE friendly, everything still displays, and you get the whole picture, just not the picture I intended you to see.
If you are using IE, your screen looks something like the picture, the navigation sidebar should not be sitting down there, it should be flush with the top of the article.
If you are using a standards approved browser, have a look at the picture and see the fun you are missing.

I will get around to fixing this, I’ve just not had the time to cross-check this site in other browsers.
