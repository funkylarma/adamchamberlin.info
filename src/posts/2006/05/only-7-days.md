This time next week it will have started, we should have left Lands End and been making our way to the other end of the UK. Iâ€™m going to enjoy this week as it is just going to be a gentle cool down with no real training or exercise. If I have not got it in my legs by now there is nothing I can do in 7 days! The only real training this week will be mental preparation. Trying to get your head round the idea of what you are going to put your body through.
