[![Suffolk Free Press Article](/images/157028034_9646b8131c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/157028034/ "Photo Sharing")Sorry this should have been posted last week, but I’ve been having a few problems with my scanner!

The local paper; Suffolk Free Press ran an article about the ride, it turns out my dear old grandma had generated interest through a family friend who works in the paper’s office. To which I was contacted and asked to organise a photo shoot at Rob’s shop.  
They got a few points mixed up such as Dave does not own the cycle shop and I’m not the chap in the middle but I think the general idea is there and the main point about the charities we are supporting are there.

Rob has also been doing some publicity for the event, appearing in some Ipswich based papers.
