No that was not a typo that is my feelings towards the show.
That’s right it is that time of year when we get the chance to watch of of life more ‘colourful’ charactors enter into a house and get cut off from the outside world.
I’m talking about Big Brother, which is in it’s 8th carnation. As you can tell this is not really my type of viewing, seriously I could walk out into the street for better entertainment and given the news I’ve heard so far this years set of social rejects are by far the best.
