The challenge is to cycle from one end of the UK to the other in 5 days!
Starting on Monday 5th June to the 10th June four cyclists will leave Lands End and hopefully all being weel and good they will arrive at John O'Groats on the following Friday.

The journey will cover the full length of the United Kingdom with daily milage reaching 175 miles and an estimated 12 hours in the saddle each day.
The journey was set out as a personal goal but it was decided that we could raise some money along the way. We are collecting for the British Heart Foundation and the League of Friends of Belstead School in Ipswich.

## The people

Who is taking part in this epic journey?

- David Law
- Harry Crampton
- Rob Morse
- and yours truly

The other three have all completed this trip at least once before in their lives, not quite at this pace but they do know what to expect. Harry is the main man, as he is now on his 10th trip and has completed the double; up and back!

## The equipment.

I will be riding my road bike for this, not sure the extra weight of the Marin is really necessary! I’ve done a quick run down of the bike and the setup.

## More…

We have already booked hotels and travel inns along the way so if you are in the area drop me a line and see what we are up to. (chances are I’ll be too tired to come out and play ;) )
Sunday: Hayle
Monday: Taunton
Tuesday: Goyborne, Haydock
Wednesday: Celkirk
Thursday: Newtonmore
Friday: Thurso

Of course there will be one hell of a party in The Park Hotel in Thurso on the Friday evening if anything goes to plan!

Once the event starts we will be keeping a log of the trip, hopefully if we can sort a internet connection I will post a daily update of the journey.
