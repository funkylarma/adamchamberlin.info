Writer

The other month Microsoft released [Live Writer](https://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2006/08/14/44.aspx), an application to enable the end user to write blog entries from the desktop.  
The idea is a nice one and so far it does fit into the whole Microsoft Office application suite very well, however with is once again a piece of Microsoft software, to which my only use is at work. Not bad come to think of it as I can sit here writing this and from a glance I could well be writing another letter to a client. Very clever!

Live Writer is still in Beta and has a few bugs but so far looks pretty interesting. All I really want is a place to add tags.  
Now lets publish this and see what extra code and markup it chucks into the post!
