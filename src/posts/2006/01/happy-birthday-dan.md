You know you're old when you wake up on a Thursday morning and realise it is your 30th birthday.
  
If you go by the national mean averages and other crap, you will know that you are nearly halfway through your existance on this planet.
  
However you look at Dan, you know you are no longer a spring chicken, time to invest in a cloth cap and some nice carpet slippers.
