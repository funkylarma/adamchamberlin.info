Levi have taken the iPod craze and gone one further.  
They have [designed][1] a pair of jeans with built in controls for the iPod. This is not the first time clothing has been done like this, I remember seeing a Burton (of snowboard fame) coat with a iPod control panel in the sleeve but a Â£250 price tag on the other!
