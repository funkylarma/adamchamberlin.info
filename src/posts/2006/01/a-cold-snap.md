At the week end I was standing in the garden tweeking my Marin wearing only just a t and thinking how good the weather was for January and how all the nah sayers had predicted a harsh winter.  
If I could go back and feel my fingers now I would.  
Yesterday the temperature on the way into work was -5c this morning it was slightly warmed at just under zero and the forecast is for more towards the following days. Yet did I resort to the car and huddle against the heater, hell no, Iâ€™m cycling in this and wishing I had a better set of gloves.
