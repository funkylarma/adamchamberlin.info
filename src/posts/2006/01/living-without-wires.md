The start of this post was going to be all about the sudden interest into ‘mobile’ web and hardware. The availability of wireless products has made it easier for us to connect to the digital world, it has radically changed my world already.  
At present I’m writing this from my iPaq while chilling in the bedroom and it suddenly struck me how much I now rely on a lack of wires!  
I walk into the house and the pda connects and checks my news feeds, then I roam the house on the iBook doing some work. Work all done? Time to relax, turn on the Xbox and guess what, you got it the wireless adaptor connects and away we go!

So I guess you just have to admire the need for wireless, I’m not 100% convinced about the security of everything just yet but I can sure get used to the ease of use.
