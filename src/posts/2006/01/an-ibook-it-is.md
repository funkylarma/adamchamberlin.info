Well after much time staring at the Apple web site I have finally decided to [make up my mind](https://adamchamberlin.info/2005/12/ibook-or-powerbook/). I’ve taken the plung and ordered a new 12inch iBook. Now I’m sure I am opening myself to the “you should have got a PowerBook!” or even now a MacBookPro comments.
Well yes except for a few things, I could not buy a product called a MacBookPro and be taken seriously. Second, for the type of use, or more appropriate wording; abuse, the machine would get the iBook was a much better choice than the PowerBook.
The final decision was on the size and to be honest this was quite simple, look at the [specs](https://www.apple.com/uk/ibook/specs.html), there is not that big a difference compared to the price.
The order has been placed now I just have to sit and wait.
