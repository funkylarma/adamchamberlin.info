I have been trying to set up [Chris](https://www.chrisjdavis.org/)’ latest offering to the WordPress community; the [LifeStream](https://www.chrisjdavis.org/2006/11/26/lifestream-ala-wordpress/) plugin. Everything looks to be working, apart from my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FunkyLarma) feed, I just can’t seem to get it to show up. I’ve run the feed through [FeedBurner](https://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/myfeeds), along with other feeds, but no joy.
