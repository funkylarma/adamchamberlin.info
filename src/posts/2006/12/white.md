There is something to be said for trying new ideas and keeping everything fresh. But there is also something to be said for actually sitting down and finishing something off; something like a WordPress theme. Exit the Black theme, enter the White version. OK so naming stuff was never really my strong point. I got a bit tired of a dark site, for most it really works for me I wanted something lighter. I guess the dark nights are calling for a lighter treat for the eyes. Yes as before when God spares me a few minutes on my own I’ll know it into a release; so how many is that now, I’m 0 for 4!
