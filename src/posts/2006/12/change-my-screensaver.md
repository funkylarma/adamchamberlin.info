Seb Rogers, the Mountain Bike photographer has released a screensaver of some his work.

> Both screensavers include some of my favourite pics as well as a clock and date function, so you can kid yourself that staring at mountain bike pictures serves some useful purpose. Enjoy!

Check out the [article](http://sebrogers.typepad.com/seb_rogers_blog/2006/12/pc_screensaver_.html) on Sebâ€™s blog. The only problem is that at present it is PC only, Mac version arriving shortly. And not a moment too late as the old hat iTunes artwork screensaver is really getting on my nerves now but it appears to be the pick of the crop for my selection. Of course I could try the [Apple Christmas screensaver](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?RSS&newsID=16768); as seen in an Apple store near you. At least it might put a festive spin on things.
