Over the last couple of days I’ve been trying to play Madden NFL 06 on the 360. This has nothing to do with the recent Superbowl I’m afraid it just so happened to be around the same time.  
However I’m having a few problems; I’m British!  
I don’t know a Blitz from a Hail Mary (ok I do know that one of those is a defensive play) and it is getting a bit frustrating trying to understand. I’m not one to walk away and apart from the game play the graphics of this game is awesome but can any help me understand the game.  
Is there an ‘American Footbal for Dummies’ site out there that will detail how to play the game? I just want to know what a half back does!
