![IT Crowd][image-1]

I’ve had the first two episodes of the [IT Crowd][1] on my iPaq for a few days, good to watch when board or on the move, but last night Channel 4 ran a double bill.

The set of the show is such a spitting image of my old job, it really felt like I was back in my old office with all the old equipment.
I’m not sure if it is a show where you have to have been in the industry to understand it and find it funny but Lucy was not as impressed as I was.
