I’ve had the first two episodes of the [IT Crowd](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/index.html) on my iPaq for a few days, good to watch when board or on the move, but last night Channel 4 ran a double bill.  
The set of the show is such a spitting image of my old job, it really felt like I was back in my old office with all the old equipment.  
I’m not sure if it is a show where you have to have been in the industry to understand it and find it funny but Lucy was not as impressed as I was.
