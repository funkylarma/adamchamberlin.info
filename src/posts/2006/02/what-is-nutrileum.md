So I was in the bath, it has been a busy time lately and I’m a strong believer in a good soak helps the body and mind relax.
  
During my r&r I looked accross at the his and hers shelf of toiletries and noticed the vast difference. On my side you have a half used can of gillette gel, some hair wax (whilst I still have some I stick gunk in it) and some mosituriser. But on Lucy’s side there is six different brands of shampoo, ok some might be conditioner. Then there is the body washes and the cleansers, one of them looks to have like paint flicks in it. Where does that stuff go when you use it.
  
What is with all the Pro-V, Nutrileum with built in active X ingredients?
