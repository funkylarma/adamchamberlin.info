For the last couple of evenings when I have been outrunning round Sudbury, I have noticed an abundance of other runners and joggers out there. On one run, I actually saw the same person twice! Once within the first 2 minutes and then on the last leg. You could say that there are still plenty of people out there taking up their New Year's resolutions and keeping fit.

Personally, I like to think that Apple/Nike have done their thing and promoted more people to get out there and run; they all have iPods (the ‘mug me’ white cables say so) and so they might all be Nike+ users. Hell, they might even have seen my ’[round the block](https://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/?l=mapit,1690290893)’ route and been trying it out.

If you are a runner or jogger from the Sudbury area, drop me a line, would be good to see how many there are out there.
