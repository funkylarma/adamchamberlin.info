It feels like ages since I’ve put together one of those more _personal_ posts were I go on about stuff that no one else really understands. But today has been one of those crazy lazy Sundays that has left me feeling quite content. Which is strange for tomorrow morning Lucy is once again off on business, this time she is only heading over to France and only for a week. But in light of that we decided to have a day of just chilling out and sorting out. 

Strange how I have not completed any of those ‘things’ that I think I should be doing, maybe they are just not that important after all? I’ve not worried about if I should be doing this or being somewhere, instead I’ve just let go and enjoyed some spare time. Think I need to try this more often as there is more to life than worrying about deadlines and keeping up with the Jones. Plenty of time next week for that…
