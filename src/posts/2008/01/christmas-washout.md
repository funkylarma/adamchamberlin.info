Rather than getting a white Christmas Lucy and I ended up with a washed out Christmas. It all started just after the turkey feast on Christmas day, Lucy was feeling a bit strange and so when to lie down. Two hours later she had a temperature and the shivers. Two hours after that I went down. We ended up cutting the family plans early and retreating home.

To which the next four days were spent in a complete mess having been struck with one hell of a flu bug. We completely missed all the celebrations and only just managed to venture outside again to see in the New Year. Now that Iâ€™m back at work it is best foot forward and can only presume it was a sign. I hope 2008 is going to be a bit better.
