Step back about 4 years and that is when I first purchased my Marin Wolf Ridge. Since then it has been my ‘knobbly’ tired bike and the bike of choice for commuting and general use. In that time it has clocked up several thousand miles and only causing [one little problem](https://adamchamberlin.info/post/1424656194/workshop). Yet on Friday when I went to the shed to remove my steed I noticed the handle bars were loose. Not just loose, the header plate on the stem had totally [snapped](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2112/2189957499_795a0460c0.jpg). The bike was totally un-ridable and I was left to use the car. Now I’m sitting here looking through stem and trying to decide the best option; cheap, reliable and of course desirable.
