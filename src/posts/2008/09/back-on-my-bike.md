That’s right, after a two-year break, I’m back on my bike and taking on the UK again.

In 2006, I cycled from [Lands End to John O'Groats](https://adamchamberlin.info/tagged/end2end/), in 2008 I’m taking the south bound road and cycling from John O'Groats to Lands End.

This time around, I’m hoping to raise money for the [Breakthough Breast Cancer](https://www.breakthrough.org.uk/) charity, following on from my [personal encounters](https://adamchamberlin.info/2007/01/christmas-is-a-trying-time/) with the disease.

Please don't hesitate to [donate](https://www.justgiving.com/3menonbikes) any spare change. I’m joining forces with David and Harry again and hope to finish the journey in seven days. Not as fast as last time, but apparently the weather will be against us most of the way; prevailing winds and all that business. Plus, I’ve not ridden a bike any distance since… well, the last time, so I’m expecting any groundbreaking performances. Of course, I would not be the geek that I am if I did not make something of it.

To which I present you with the [Long Cycle Down web site](https://longcycledown.com). Yes, I was watching Ewan and Charlie when registering a domain name. Please drop by and offer some support or make a donation.
