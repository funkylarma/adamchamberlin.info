I’ve decided to go for it with Tiger. My real concern is about applications not working, yet I realised currently I’m only really using iPhoto and some other Mac programs. I’m hoping these will come out the other side smiling, so what the hey. Plus if you pre-order from the Apple Store you get an invitation to an online seminar showing you numerous tips and trix for the OS, a free chip butty would be better but still cool!
