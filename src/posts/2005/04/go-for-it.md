I’ve decided to go for it with Tiger. My real concern is for applications not working yet I realised at the moment I’m only really using iPhoto and some other Mac programs. I’m hoping these will come out the other side smiling so what the hey. Plus if you pre-order from the Apple store you get an invitation to a online seminar showing you lots of tips and trix for the OS, a free chip butty would be better but still cool!
