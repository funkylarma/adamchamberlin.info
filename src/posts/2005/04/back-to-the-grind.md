![GT4 Challenge](/images/gt4-chall.gif)  
Been a while since the last update and to be honest I’m glad, I’ve spent the last day just not wanting to look at a televison or computer screen after the GT4 race.

The whole event went really well and it was a good laugh, but I am glad I did book the Monday off work just to make sure. Not really tired but it was nice to finally have a day to just do those things that weeks ends are there for. But now I have that Monday feeling on a Tuesday, hmmm..
