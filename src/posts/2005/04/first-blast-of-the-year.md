Today was the first day I decided to bike to work this year. Normally once the weather improves I near enough live on the bike but once it turns cold I just shy away indoors.  
Friday morning the weather was looking good, but they have planned on re-surfacing the road outside my house so all the cars were is chaos, meaning parking was in short demand. I opted to park the car and get on the bike to ensure I kept my place ;)
