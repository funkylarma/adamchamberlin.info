Recieved one of my weekly email updates from Muriel Barnes last night and she has passed on the comments of:

> Just a quick line to let you know that your baby is getting along fine.? The attached pic was taken this morning after breakfast, although Pickle doesn’t actually have any now, she is offered supper only as is getting quite good at eating on her own now……….so she should be O.K. for collection? next weekend (7/8 May).?

This is great, only a couple of weeks and finally the parrot we have been watching grow can finally join us. [Photo Album](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/tags/pickle/)
