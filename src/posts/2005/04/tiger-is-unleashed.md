It looks like the wait is over, the release date for Tiger has been [confirmed](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/apr/12tiger.html). Placing a pre-order with the Apple Store will mean your copy will arrive on the 29th. Now I only have one question, do I upgrade on the day? All the nice new features of Tiger are appealing, but can I'm done with the standard broken apps and corrupt permissions that are always there during an upgrade? Got a bit of time to think about it, I guessâ€¦
