With the weather getting better by the day I’m getting out on the bike more. Yet last year I was struggling to get all my crap to work in one bag and find a nice comfortable bag to do so!
I’ve decided to purchase a new, larger, Camelbak this year so that everything can come with me. I opted for the Havok, which despite not getting a great review so far is designed for the ‘Free-rider’ yet seemed perfectly specc'ed for me, 3l Omega bladder and all the usual extras. Best place I found was at [Chain Reaction Cycles](https://www.chainreactioncycles.com)
