Today Lucy and I had a quick drive up to Attleborough to meet Muriel and Keith Barnes who are currently breading out baby Senegal parrot; Pickle.  
It was a pleasure to meet them, and Pickle, and I canâ€™t thank them enough. We found it hard to come away empty handed but we know that Pickle is a few weeks off from being fully ready for a new home. So I guess we just sit and wait until then, thank you Muriel!  
Some pictures until the day anyway:
