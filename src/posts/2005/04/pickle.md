Today, Lucy and I had a quick drive up to Attleborough to meet Muriel and Keith Barnes, who are currently breading our baby Senegal parrot; Pickle.

It was a pleasure to meet them, and Pickle, and I can’t thank them enough. We found it difficult to come away empty-handed, but we know that Pickle is a few weeks off from being fully ready for a new home. So I guess we just sit and wait until then, thank you, Muriel!

Some pictures until the day anyway:
