Some might say that this is a bit late, well yes it is. The reason is quite simple; I just decided to spend a few days away from a keyboard and spend it with family and friends, it felt like the right thing to do.  
None the less have a happy and safe holiday and make the most of the new year. Remember to drink way too much and gorge yourself on unhealthy foods.
