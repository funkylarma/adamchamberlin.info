Found [this](http://www.it-observer.com/articles.php?id=972) link detailing the future of my friend the sober worm. In the last few days I’ve really got to know this chap, he sends me quite a few emails now and I really enjoy waiting for the next.  
On a serious note this could be interesting, if it does go ahead as planned I think the internet could have a couple of _slow_ days. Kinda makes you just want to give up on the internet, if it wern’t for porn I don’t even know why I have it ;)
