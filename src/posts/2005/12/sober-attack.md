Found [this][1] link detailing the future of my friend the sober worm. In the last few days I’ve really got to know this chap, he sends me quite a few emails now and I really enjoy waiting for the next.
  
On a serious note this could be interesting, if it does go ahead as planned I think the internet could have a couple of _slow_ days. Kinda makes you just want to give up on the internet, if it wern’t for porn I don’t even know why I have it ;)
