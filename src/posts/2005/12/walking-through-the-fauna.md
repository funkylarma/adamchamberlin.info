I’ve decided to have a bit of a change around again on the site. This time I’m messing about with [Joens’s](http://www.noscope.com) [Fauna](http://www.noscope.com/fauna/) theme.  
Joen is a great designer and this theme just about sums it up, be sure to stop by his site for more news and views from the horses mouth. I’m not waving goodbye to the K2 scene, you can not ignore the support and community that [Michael](http://www.binarybonsai.com) has created and as the Joen and Michael appear to get on quite well I thought I might try and mix the two themes and see what one gels.  
I have to admit I do love the very ‘light’ feel to this theme, that background is superb but I’m not too sure about the colour scheme thou. Well time to have a look under the bonnet and see what ticks.
