This week end is the [Suffolk Kite Flyers](https://www.skfc.co.uk) annual festival, also known as the Suffolk Kite Festival.

Having been a member (long story I guess) I felt the need to offer my hand at setting up the show ground ready for the displays. But having the time off work and looking after Pickle Iâ€™ve not really had much time in the saddle so I decided to make the trip on the bike rather than a stuffy car.

It was only about half way there when I thought it was a waste of time, it soon passed and in fact it was a good laugh.

End milage was 47, which by some is not far but for my crippled body and recovering nicotine coated lungs it was a nice change.
