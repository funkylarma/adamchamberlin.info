Well it was good to know that this morning that dreaded feeling of _‘what have I forgotten to do for work on Monday’_ were short lived. For once I’ve some time off work and all I have left to think about is what shall I do to fill the time?  
Well the real reason for the time off is Pickle, well that and the fact that they kicked me out of the office as I’ve not taken any time off. As Pickle has come from a busy bird rich house and now moved into a much larger cage on her own I just wanted to be about to make sure she settles in. Plus it might be a good time to catch up on some other work.
