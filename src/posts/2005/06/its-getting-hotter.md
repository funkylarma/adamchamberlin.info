Friday night was a real scorcher at work. It was a nice bright morning when i first woke up, but then the clouds covered the skies just as i wanted to sit in the garden! They finally cleared as i was cooking my lunch and getting ready to go to work. When i got to work, i got suited and boated only to find that our shop floor was at least 30'C. To top it off, we had to fix a broken motor coupling on a phosphate plant in which we had to sit above the wash tanks that are heated to 70'C. I sat 12 feet, getting covered in grease, and sweating like a fat boy in a cake shop! What a way to spend your friday night.
