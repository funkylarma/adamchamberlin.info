I was sitting at the desk this afternoon updating the site and creating some more nodes on the Wiki and having a general tidy up. Quite a nice time too; iTunes on and just typing away when suddenly a click and total silence…  
First thoughts are is was just us, turned out to be the whole street, so what do you do? Can’t even have a cup of tea to pass the time, how sad.  
This was a good time to try and catch up with some reading, I have previously purchased a copy of ‘Angels & Demons’ by Dan Brown; from 'The Da Vinci Code’ fame, and so decided this might be a good time to start reading it.  
It was good to sit there with out any distractions and just chill out, despite the feeling I was babysitting for some one (Lucy!)

Eventually the power was restored and I decided to carry on with the site update. So upstairs I went and booted my \[\[G5\]\] and everything looked fine, now to start \[\[iTunes\]\] and carry on…  
This is where the problems began. Somewhere my \[\[iTunes\]\] library had corrupted during the power cut. The raw files are still on the disk but the linking \[\[xml\]\] file has gone totally t\*ts up!  
Every file will need relinking and 'finding’ again so I guess I pick a wet Sunday afternoon and relink the files, unless any one has a handy Automator work flow or a script that can do it all?
