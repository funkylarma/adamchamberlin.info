**Update:** It turns out the details Mr. Bumper Humper gave me are a complete load of poo apart from the number plate. Now I have the fun decision of do I take this matter further; hmmm… hell yes!

Everyone gets a bit down on a Monday morning, it’s only natural you have got to go back to after a few days off. But this morning it all just felt a little bit worse than that. My week end was not the greatest with the highlight being some idiot in a VW trying to mount the back of my Audi and scuffing all the paint in the process. Apart from that all in all it was not bad but with the looming joys of house hunting I am currently sitting at work wondering where all the fun has gone.
