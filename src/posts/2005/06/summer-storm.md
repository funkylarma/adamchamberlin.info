[![](/images/22316186_275b1c91e4_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/22316186/ "Lightening")Last night we experienced one of the best electric storms we have had so far this year.  
It is hardly surprising the weather has been getting hotter and hotter and the air just so ‘heavy’ with that close feeling about it that you knew it was going to happen.  
Lucy and I were sitting downstairs talking about houses when it first started rumbling, so we decided to move upstairs and look out over the water meadows for a better view. I tried constantly to get a photo of the storm but I just could not get the exposure or focus right, I think I took about 80 shots but only three contained anything that looked like a storm.  
If you know how to photograph lightening please let me know!
