Lucy and I hit the roads and enjoyed the sunshine this morning. It was by far one of the hottest days we have had this year and after a quick climb out of Sudbury we stopped to enjoy the view of what there was on offer. After the breather we set off again and carried on round the local countryside only to find ourselves at a lovely ford just outside Arga Fenn were we sat just chilling for a bit.
