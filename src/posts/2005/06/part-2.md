[This night](http://www.shibbyonline.co.uk/blog/?p=70) was more orientated around the office staff of Grabor Plastics and so part 2 was for the shop floor workers, you know the real people behind any company.  
Some how I got invited to that as well. Once again an ugly night was soon to follow and the damage was done.  
It was good to meet up again, despite spending most of the night talking to Kay; yar-great, about the duality of man and the influence of religion and politics and the outcome within the human fabric of this world. That and how warm Guiness gets if you leave it too long, what ever it was congratulations of your first!  
Just a quick thanks to Trevor and Marlene for your welcome and crazy colour drinks.
