Microsoft has released the new name for its upcoming OS; Longhorn, it will now be known as Windows Vista. Longhorn has been in the pipeline for a while and whilst rumoured it should be released some time in 2156! Only joking, but the timescale has been put back and back whilst they concentrate on ‘fixing’ existing Windows versions.

The plan is for Beta1 of Vista to be released first part of August, with Beta2 beginning part of next year and I final release towards the end of 2006.

This new version of Windows is being interface lead, hence the name; 'pleasing view’ and will see numerous interesting features based around the user and their experiences. Only time will tell that the minimum requirements for this version will be but expect to have to purchase a new machine to run it ;)
