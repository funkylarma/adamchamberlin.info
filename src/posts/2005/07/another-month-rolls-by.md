We are now on the third day in July already, the year just seems to be cruising by in a blur. This is the seventh month already, the days will be getting shorter and the darkness will begin to grow, it felt like only the other day I was sitting there thinking ‘when will summer get here’ now all of a sudden you realise you better make the most of it; which is difficult with the decline in the British weather!

Despite that I can now say that shibbyonline and the blog have been going for nearly 6 months now, OK it’s not the greatest or most interesting site in the world but it has turned into a pleasing hobby and look forward to the future and the changes ahead.
