It appears that the web is alive with maps currently, the in thing is [Earth Google](https://earth.google.com) with the new [Google Maps](https://maps.google.co.uk) also being popular. Is this the new way of looking at the world as a small space where we are all connected? Well, it could well be.  

Whilst Iâ€™ve not tried Earth Google yet as its PC only but the Google Maps is pretty cool, makes you wonder how Columbus ever found land without them. By the way, this is my local [area](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=sudbury&ll=52.036078,.721149&spn=0.008205,0.008745&t=k&hl=en)
