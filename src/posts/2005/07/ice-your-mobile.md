> In an emergency situation ambulance and hospital staff will then be able to quickly find out who your next of kin are and be able to contact them. It’s so simple that everyone can do it. Please do.

> Please will you also email this to everybody in your address book, it won’t take too many ‘forwards’ before everybody will know about this. It really could help the emergency services in doing their job.

> For more than one contact name ICE1, ICE2, ICE3 etc.
