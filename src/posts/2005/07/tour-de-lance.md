It was sort of decided before the race began that if Lance Armstrong finished this Tour de France then he would be standing on the podium, with 6 tour wins already the chance of making it seven was too tempting, even he admitted that he could not just ride the tour, he had to win it.

After Stage 18 Armstrong is already nearly three minutes ahead of the next man; Ivan Basso and with the final leg back to Paris today and the time trails left on Saturday it only goes to say that on Sunday’s final day of racing, Armstrong will get his seventh win.

Seventh but last win of the tour, it was announced that he would retire after this and concentrate on other important parts of his life; the Livestrong foundation being number one. So for team Discovery Channel (old USPS) this leaves them captain-less, who could fill Armstrong’s shoes?
There are a lot of rumors and whispers in and around the tour at the moment as to who is going to sign with who for the next years riding.
Good luck to all riders and don’t worry Monday you can rest!
