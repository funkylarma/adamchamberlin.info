Ka-Meng posted a question in the [binary bonsai](https://www.flickr.com/groups/binarybonsai/discuss/95205/) discussion group about trying to implement a ‘Alert’ banner instead of changing code each time. On my daily cruise through the groups I noticed this and for once opted not to remain an unnamed reader and as I thought I could try and help; hmmm…  
Needless to say the mod is working with help from [Matt Boothby](https://www.donnybrookcheer.com/2005/10/04/alert-message-in-k2/). I’m even trying it out on here, gives me an idea for an update banner as well.  
If you fancy making site alerts that little bit easier drop by [cause an effect](https://rayz.notdesign.net/2005/10/01/alert-message-option-in-k2/) and try it out.
