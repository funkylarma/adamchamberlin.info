[K2][1] has the built in features for [gravatar][2]’s. To be honest when I first saw them I thought of it more as a gimic rather than a useful plugin, but now looking at whole scheme of the idea I realised it is so simple yet so effective!

I’ve spent the last couple of days thinking the idea over I decided I would give it a crack, but looking at the site Tom Werner is having a few problems. Now we have a problem, I wanted something and I can’t have it, now I _need_ it!
