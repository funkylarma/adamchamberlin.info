For the last few months my beloved Marin Wolf Ridge has been complaining of a worn out and knackered bottom bracket. Finally today I took it to Rob at LifeCycle UK (who I can not recommend enough!) to have a shiny new Race Face chainset fitted. I’ve opted for the new ‘x’ type chainset which has an external bearing fitment which should last a bit longer and take a bit more abuse. Now just need some daylight to test it out.
