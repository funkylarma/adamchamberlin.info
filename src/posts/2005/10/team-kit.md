Lucy has treated me on my birthday and presented me with a complete set of Trek/Discovery Channel Team cycle wear; ok I have not got the socks but I’ll let that one slide. The clothing which is made by Nike is top quality and looks the part, I guess the phrase ‘all the gear and on idea’ springs to mind.  
Best I get out on my bike now and put to some use, just got to overcome the British weather.
