[![have a mint](/images/50321697_816ebe0702_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/50321697/ "mint")I decided to give [mint](http://haveamint.com) a try as a new way to monitor web traffic (if any).  
there has been a lot of hype about [mint](http://haveamint.com) before it’s release but you know me I’m never one to jump too soon so I held back and to be honest it has had some mixed reviews, on the whole I think it has gone down a storm with the newer blogging crowd. I think the old schoolers out there have criticised the price tag of the application and claiming that there are other alternatives out there without the outlay. true. but [mint](http://haveamint.com) is all about _‘a fresh look at your site’_ and to be honest I have to agree on that one, the user interface is very crisp, clean and minty fresh really.  
whether it works or not, only time will tell.
