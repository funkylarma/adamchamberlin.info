 [![have a mint][image-1]][1]
I decided to give [mint][2] a try as a new way to monitor web traffic (if any).
there has been a lot of hype about [mint][3] before it’s release but you know me I’m never one to jump too soon so I held back and to be honest it has had some mixed reviews, on the whole I think it has gone down a storm with the newer blogging crowd. I think the old schoolers out there have criticised the price tag of the application and claiming that there are other alternatives out there without the outlay. true. but [mint][4] is all about _‘a fresh look at your site’_ and to be honest I have to agree on that one, the user interface is very crisp, clean and minty fresh really.
whether it works or not, only time will tell.
