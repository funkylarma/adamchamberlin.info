 <!-- [![have a mint][image-1]][1] -->
I decided to give [mint](https://haveamint.com) a try as a new way to monitor web traffic (if any).
There has been a lot of hype about [mint](https://haveamint.com) before its release, but you know me, I’m never one to jump too soon so I held back and to be honest, it has had some mixed reviews, on the whole, I think it has gone down a storm with the newer blogging crowd. I think the old schoolers out there have criticised the price tag of the application and claiming that there are other alternatives out there without the outlay. True. But [mint](https://haveamint.com) is all about _‘a fresh look at your site’_ and to be honest, I have to agree on that one, the user interface is very crisp, clean and minty fresh really.
Whether it works or not, only time will tell.
