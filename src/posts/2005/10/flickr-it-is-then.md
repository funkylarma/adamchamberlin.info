we all sat in the pub last night to celebrate Sarah’s birthday (hope you had a good one in the end!) and the subject of ‘whatcha doing tomorrow came up’. Lucy was simple; working so that left me with two options. 1. dust off my bike and head out on a epic or 2. update my flickr album and sort out the flickr plugin here. well the head ache this morning helped clinch the deal.
