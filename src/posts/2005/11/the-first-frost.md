The other day I woke to be greated by the first blanket of white in the autumn.  
So far we have had a very mild October followed by a similar beginning to November, finally the temperature has dropped and it would appear to be back to normal.  
Personally Iâ€™m not a fan of the cold, I need by warmth, but it has been eerie still riding about in summer short clothing and not worrying about the weather.  
Be warned the people in the know are forecasting a severe winter with the mercury dropping like no other year.
