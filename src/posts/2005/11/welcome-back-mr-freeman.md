 [![HalfLife 2][image-1]][1]
Lucy shocked me to bits the yesterday by returning home with some curtain liners (yep I was that impressed) but also a copy of Half Life 2 (now I was impressed by that!)
Half Life 2 has been knocking about the pc world for a while now and is no doubt last months news, but for those of us who enjoy the pleasures of a Mac can only wait until it was released on the Xbox.
Of course the graphics are not as good as the pc version and there is no multi-player option, strange given that Counterstrike was Live enabled, but the game is looking to be quite good. I can only say looking as for some reason Lucy has taken over the Xbox and refusing to let go of the controller until the nasty things are dead!
