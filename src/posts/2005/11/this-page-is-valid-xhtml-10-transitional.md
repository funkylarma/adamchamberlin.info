No, not this page, you must be joking! But I have created my first site that passed with flying colours.
  
OK, it’s not much and no big deal, but it does make you feel better when the [Validator](https://validator.w3.org) comes back with that nice green bar. For most of the day I have been working on a new site for Oscar Products (the place I work) and thought it would be pleasant to make it all valid now, it looks good from a business perspective, ‘bit like Investors in People for websites’ as it was explained. So plugging away and using a trial version of Dreamweaver8 as a nice handy local validator finally the pages that are viewable so far are all reporting full XHTML1.0 valid, even the CSS file is sorted!
