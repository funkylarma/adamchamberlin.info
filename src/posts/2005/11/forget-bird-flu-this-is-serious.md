OK it is not quite that bad but a little bit of hype never hurt anyone.
Last week I was experiencing some nasty [virus][1] problems, this morning I fully expected to be greeted by another couple of hundred emails stuffed full of virii (hmm sounds cool that) but no. Looks like it might have calmed down, or they have moved on I guess. But whilst I was checking my morning feeds and feeding my morning needs I came accross [this][2] article from a ComputerWeekly email. Well the slowdown it is hardly surprising the amount of traffic it produces. My inbox was being choked on 15mb of virus each time it checked for mail. Even thou my hunting ground of choice is a Mac the idea of these virus just taking up space and bandwidth is concerning, maybe we should look at flu shots for the internet?
