It’s been a bit quiet on the site of late, I think this is just things catching up with me. Easter was a tiring time with Lucy’s birthday thrown in. Too many dark days and bright nights were enjoyed but now I need rest.  
The only interesting item to post about was I purchased iLife05 from Apple. Because I only got my G5 at the beginning of the year (two days before the release of iLife05), Apple are running a nice upgrade scheme to which I took part in. I have to admit the only app I really use is iPhoto but will test the rest and see what they are like.
