To be honest I’m not normally a fan of driving wheels or things like that. I just think a video game is just that, a game and any thing like these are just overkill.  
I will stand corrected and eat my hat and what ever else you have to do as today Lucy managed to find a Logitech Driving Force Pro steering wheel for the PlayStation2. The reason for this sudden change of heart is simply down to the Gran Turismo 4 challenge!  
According to the company blurb and the Gran Turismo leaflet this wheel was made especially for the game and features 900 degrees of movement and force feed back. I’ve not yet tested it but from the looks of the box and the wheel itself it looks a hefty bit of kit.
