Today was the release of Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation2. I received my copy as usual and as of, yet Iâ€™m undecided about the game. By far, Polyphony have spent their time on the look and feel of the game, but this whole photo gallery idea instead of some good network play seems a bit strange. True, you can play a nice lan battle, but with Xbox running away with the Live scene you would have thought it's best to try to tackle the online market.

Apart from that, this game is really polished, I had forgotten what it was like to play a real driving simulator for a long time.
