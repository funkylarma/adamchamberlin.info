Microsoft’s second version of its Xbox console will feature a CPU with PowerPC cores, according to [GameSpy](https://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/microsoft-xbox/594331p1.html?fromint=1), which claims to have scooped the specifications.

I heard rumours of a PowerPC chip behind this machine many moons ago but decided not to believe the hype until confirmed. I’m still not convinced this is a 100% water proof M$ approved spec sheet so here’s to still holding your breath.
