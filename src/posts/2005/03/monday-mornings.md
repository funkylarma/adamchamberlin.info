Monday mornings are never really the best, but this morning was a different matter. For some reason, there was an extra brightness in the sky and the air was smelling just that little sweeter. Does this mean spring is on the way?  
I damn well hope so, I’m fed up with the cold and miserable weather, I need some sun and a bit of warmth through my veins?

This extra feeling carried all the way to work where it just felt better, add this to the fact that some pressure of a big contract has lifted, I could be in for a bit of time to myself. Who knows, I might even be able to get back on Xbox Live soon or even work on some unfinished prjects.
