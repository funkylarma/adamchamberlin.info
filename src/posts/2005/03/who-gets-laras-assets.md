SCI has today announced a bid to buy into Eidos.  
Eidos recently have not been on top of the world despite bringing the world Lara Croft, along with many other titles which completely slip my mind. They announced a major loss and requested a takeover to secure their future.  

The first to step forward was Bono (US lead singer) orientated partnership, Elevation Partners. Obviously, SCI has considered the options and proposed a £76.1m injection, whilst this is larger that Elevation’s offer of £71m cash buy out, SCI are proposing a share scheme.  

Whatever happens, expect most Eidos games to be delayed whilst this is fought out!
