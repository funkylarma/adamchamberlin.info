Many moons ago I started looking into web sites and the languages behind them. Not being qualified or anything like that and only looking into this as a hobby I decided to try and teach myself HTML. Now I’m not trying to blow my own trumpet but it seemed to be going quite well. I created quite a few sites and the whole process really got me thinking. I then moved onto learning a bit of php and some basic MySQL, finally moving into Flash and some simple ActionScript

Well i took a break from it all and have come back only to find the standards have moved and there is a new code on the block. I’m not the sort of person to shy away so I decided the other day to start afresh and relearn the basics. So with plenty of resources, coffee and the odd Stella I’m ready to tackle XHTML and CSS!
