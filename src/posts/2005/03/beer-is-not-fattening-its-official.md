Today the register announced the following:

> Those of us who like a few pints already know that beer [fights cancer](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/20/beer_fights_cancer/) and is an absolute [life-saver](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/avalanche_escape/) in an avalanche emergency situation, but what about the apparently proven effect of ale on the old waistline, eh?  
> After all, anyone who has ever been on a package holiday to the Spanish costas can attest to the terrifying expansion of the British male’s belly in response to a few hundred gallons of San Miguel…  
> Or maybe not. A new campaign by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), as reported on the [BBC](https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4329323.stm), highlights the most satisfying fact that beer in reality has less calories than wine, milk or orange juice - 41, 77, 64 and 42 per cent per 100ml, respectively.  
> What actually causes the beer belly is the overwhelming desire to partake of an enormous kebab or plate of curry after a particularly robust session, the BBPA says. This is true, although the BBPA is not taking in account something else all beer-drinkers know: that doner kebabs combat male pattern baldness and curry increases attractiveness to the opposite sex.  
> Which is why people who prefer wine are invariably bald and single - despite having a waistline like Calista Flockhart.

What can you say to this, without doubt this is going to be some of the best news this week!
