There was always going to be the feeling of not being complete with a \[\[Apple\]\] mouse. It only has one button after all! \[\[Windows\]\] users have been using two buttons for years and even the extreme of 6 buttons and yaw control and stabilizers and all other pretty functions. Yes you can attach a two button mouse to your \[\[Mac\]\] but then you lose that wonderful white scheme which to mean is one of the best features of being a Mac user. (To be picky I do use a S+ARCK mouse anyway) So to my delight I give you the Mac [Mighty Mouse](http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/)
