on the usual trail through a week’s worth of rss feeds and inbox fluff I found [this](http://www.games-digest.com/2005/08/xbox_360_withou.html) interesting article about the backwards compatiblity of the \[\[Xbox360\]\].  
You know what that sort of policy just does not sound like \[\[Microsoft\]\]’s way at all, sorry I did have my fingers crossed there for a bit.
