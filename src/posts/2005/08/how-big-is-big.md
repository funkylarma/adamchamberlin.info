It used to be the case if you had a 28inch telly you were the daddy on the block, then people laughed at you because everyone else had 32inchers. Then with Plasma displays the ego tripping screen estate agents were treated to 42inch, 52inch, how far will it go?  
How about 71inch? Not only that but HD set as well? Lucky [Samsung have the answer](http://www.aving.co.kr/newproduct/default.asp?p1=newproduct&mode=read&page_table_id=&table_id=English&num=19&brd_name=&brand_num_list=&gotopage=1&other_table=). Now I’m not too hot on my Korean but I do understand the pictures, hmmmm, I’ll take two.
