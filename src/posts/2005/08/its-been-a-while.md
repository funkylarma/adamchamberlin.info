I’m sorry for my lack of posts lately, if it wern’t for gravy I think the site might have been dead! I’m having a few problems just getting myself to sit down in front of a computer and concentrate.

Last week I was on holiday and sort of tried not to do too much computer related, a bit of a detox session if that makes sense, but it looks like it has had some knock on effects. Since then I’ve started really beginning training on the cycling front which is now taking up a lot of time and not really leaving me with a feeling to sit back down and keep with place updated.

All I can say is hopefully I’ll be back soon, until then keep up the good work gravy ;)
