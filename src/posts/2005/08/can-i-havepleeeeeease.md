is going to be the cry all over the land soon.  
[play.com](http://www.play.com/play247.asp?pa=hp&page=title&r=X360&title=659411) have put the \[\[Xbox360\]\] on pre-order already along with a load of games and tasty little extras. Whilst I have to admit I though the price was going to be a bit higher I still think I can hold off on the purchase and wait for sales to settle.  
What am I thinking, it is only a preliminary release date and it is the end of November! How about we just sit and wait and see what happens, please reframe from getting too excited, well ok just a little bit.
