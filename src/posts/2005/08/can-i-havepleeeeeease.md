It will be the cry all over the land soon.
[play.com](https://www.play.com/play247.asp?pa=hp&page=title&r=X360&title=659411) has put the Xbox360 on pre-order already, along with a load of games and tasty little extras. Whilst I have to admit I thought the price was going to be a bit higher, I still think I can hold off on the purchase and wait for sales to settle.
What am I thinking, it is only a preliminary release date, and it is the end of November! How about we just sit and wait and see what happens, please reframe from getting too excited, well, OK just a bit.
