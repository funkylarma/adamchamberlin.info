It’s been a while since I’ve messed about with a Linux system and checked out what is happening in the Open Source environment. To which when I read on OSNews that SuSe had a download Beta of the new version 10.0 of there OS I decided to check it out. Sorry to say that at present I can’t get the graphics card in my PC to work with the Apple Cinema screen and so it just gives me a blurry outlook on the system. Guess I’ll be waiting for my other monitor to return ;)
