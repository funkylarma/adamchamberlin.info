Well, this is my last post for a while, in a few minutes I will finally have to draw the fun to an end. The G5 will be shut down for the move and unfortunately, at present I have no internet connection at the new house, so I will have to pass the reins onto gravy2012. Iâ€™m sure he will keep the world posted about the country's humour and fun and well beings of Sudbury.

It's been an adventure, but there is still a bigger adventure ahead. See you all in the new surroundings!
