Last night I took a trip down to _‘The Big Smoke’_ to see some friends play a gig in The Metro Club on Oxford Street. The band is called CTRL.ALT.DELETE and has only recently been re-grouped for a few months after the split of the previous band 'Nausea’ about 4 or 5 years ago. The band have been practising hard and are trying to make a name for themselves around the London area.

Last night's performance was a request from the club after they got a copy of the demo. Unfortunately, due to bad traffic and train delays, I only managed to catch about three quarters of the last song! This did frustrate me somewhat, but the reaction from the crowd at the end and the general comments from the viewers said the gig was superb!

I am eagerly awaiting the guys' next gig which they are playing at [The Windmill Club](https://www.windmillbrixton.co.uk/) in Brixton on Thursday the 11th of August. They are supporting fellow band friends [Roland Shanks](https://www.rolandshanks.com/) at their single release party, so there maybe some _'bigwigs’_ there that like what they hear! Good Luck Guys!
