After putting a few pictures on the blog from my boat trip, Mr Craft asked for a link so he could get a close up look of the pictures.

This inspired me to try to sort out my [.Mac Homepage.](https://homepage.mac.com/seanchamberlin/Menu4.html) When I subscribed to [.Mac](https://www.mac.com/WebObjects/Welcome.woa), they gave me 150mb of webspace to display some of my files, photos, movies, etc. I have finally got around to putting the photos into albums and sorting them into order.
You are welcome to check it out at any time, as I will keep adding until I have no more space left!!!
