![iPod Nano][image-1]
Its looks like [Apple][1] are trying to upgrade the mini with a new colour screen version. The release of the [iPod Nano][2] takes this role nicely, with a 2GB and 4GB version with prices starting at around £139 direct from the [Apple Store][3]. This small new mp3 player also has the capabilities of the larger iPods for storing photos and creating slideshows for mobile displays.

The Nano will be a great accessory for those who have not got an mp3 player or who want to upgrade theirs. No wonder [Walkers Crisps][4] are giving away an [iPod every five minutes][5], I suspect Apple have a few leftover!!
