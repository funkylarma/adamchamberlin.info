![iPod Nano](/images/ipodnano_family_1.jpg-thumb_140_105.jpg)  
Its looks like [Apple](http://www.apple.com/uk/) are trying to upgrade the mini with a new colour screen version. The release of the [iPod Nano](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodnano/) takes this role nicely, with a 2GB and 4GB version with prices starting at around Â£139 direct from the [Apple Store](http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/90501/wo/RS1lK1BGHZxm2xfpbwraY6OXnTG/0.0.15.1.0.6.23.1.0.1.0.0.0.1.0). This small new mp3 player also has the capabilities of the larger iPods for storing photos and creating slideshows for mobile displays.  
The Nano will be a great accessory for those who have not got an mp3 player or who want to upgrade theirs. No wonder [Walkers Crisps](http://walkers.corpex.com/cr15p5/index.htm) are giving away an [iPod every five minutes](http://www.winwithwalkers.co.uk/), I suspect Apple have a few leftover!!
