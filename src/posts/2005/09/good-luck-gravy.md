Just a quick note to say good luck Gravy, we all know you have been worrying about your short trip to the dreaded ‘H’ but don’t it’s fine. I mean if anything does go wrong, it is wonderful what they can do now with reconstructive surgery. Look at MJ, just think you might end up just like him.

Good luck fella.
