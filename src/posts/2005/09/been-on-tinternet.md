sorry it’s a Peter Kay joke..

**Update:**
We now have internet in the whole house. My wireless Access Points arrived and after some fiddling we are firing on all cylinder's now!

Anyway this evening I’ve got one step closer to finally getting an internet service at my new house.
I decided to renew my service with [Pipex](https://www.pipex.net) but as usual there were problems at the local exchange. Turns out I should have been connected a while ago but there was a line sharing problem, yeah great one BT.
Well this evening I finally plugged in my router to be greeted by a lovely green light indicating a ADSL service was active on my line. Now all I need is my wireless access points to create the network and then I can plug in my G5 and finally update this site!
