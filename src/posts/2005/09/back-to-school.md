Of all things it looks like I will be going back to study some more.  
As some of you will know I’m no web guru or full time coder I am just a person with an unhealthy obsession with web sites and all my knowledge and experience is 100% self taught. It was decided by my company that I should get a qualification or as least a bit of paper to say I can do what I do, so when some ‘free’ courses are available through the local business link exchange they signed me up to the _'web design in the digital age’_ course.  
Last night I went along to the enrolement session only to recieve a copy of the proposed 10 week course outline:

> - 1\. Understand the concept of web page design and website structure.
> - 2\. Design and create web pages with hyperlinks to a specified theme.
> - 3\. Incorporate web design effects and transitions.
> - 4\. Create a website and launch it on the internet.

I’m not trying to be big headed or show off or anything but I don’t think I’m going to need two weeks to work out how to create a hyperlink!  
To which I had a quick chat with the tutor after the session and explained I can 'read’ code, I’m quite happy trying my hand at php, asp and to some limits ActionScript. It was then decided that maybe this could be below my level of self taught experience but it would still be nice to have a bit of paper to say I can do what I can do so carry on with the course but was there something else I would like to try.  
I found they are also offering some Photoshop courses, hmmmm, I’ve always fancied knowing more about this very powerful package and so I’ve signed up for that. I also took a copy of a e-commerce course but decided that two nights a week might be pushing the limits on this.  
My first session of the Photoshop course starts on Monday 26th, must remember to pick up a new 'A-Team’ pencil case at the weekend.
