Ok I will admit defeat and accept that at present I’m not going to get any cycling done for a while. In fact I’ve been thinking I might have to knock the training program on the head until Christmas.  
It was bad enough knowing the evenings are getting darker and the days shorter, which meant no more trails through the cooling sunny shadows. But now with these courses and the extra _homework_ I don’t think I’m going to have much time to myself at all. Of course there will still be the odd week end when I can get out and about, (lucky the Sudbury Cycle Club have just started their Sunday sessions) but it is looking more like the bikes will sit in the shed until life settles down a bit.
