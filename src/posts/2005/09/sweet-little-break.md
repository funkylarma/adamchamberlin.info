Lucy and I are currently enjoying a sweet break from the grind at the moment and taking a sojoun at Stamford.

We have come to visit Lucy’s brother and sister-in-law; Ant & Charlotte and at the time of writing enjoyed one too many _Bishops Farewell_. Check out my Flickr account for the ‘Tight Warriors’
