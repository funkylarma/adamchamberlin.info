<!-- ![Fear and Loathing][image-1] -->
After first watching this film almost five years agos, i have been waiting for the release of it onto DVD, but finally [Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas][1] has arrived to Europe. For a long time the film was only available on VHS or DVD Region 1, but as of 1st September 2005, the film has been released in Region 2.

The film follows the hallucinogenic and crazed adventures of Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his eterny Dr. Gonzo (Benecio Del Toro) as they travel to Las Vegas to collect and write press stories. The story follows the original writen book [(same title)][2] by Hunter S. Thompson about the pairs adventure in the drug ruled times of 1971. The feature has small cameos from various famous faces such as, Cameron Diaz, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci and Flea from the ‘Red Hot Chili Peppers’.

The film itself is quite strange and confusing and can be a handful to follow sometimes, but the character depiction and the acting is second to none. I would highly recommend this to any one who thinks outside the box and needs a good laugh!
