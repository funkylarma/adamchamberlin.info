It is no secret I’m passionate about cycling, but the truth is I had never been handed a number and tried racing; until last year.
Since cycling kicked off for me back in 2006 I have completed a list of challenges, I’ve pushed myself with my own goals. However, all my events have been team outings or lacked that competitive edge. It was not without temptation; members of Cycle Club Sudbury had always asked if I wanted to try their time trial series, but racing was always missing from my cycling requirements.

Roll on some seven odd years, and I’m still just pootling about in my own little way. I’ve moved and joined Hadleigh Cycling Club, found some really great people to ride with and started doing a bit of off-road riding.
Finally, in April last year I succumbed to Tony’s suggestion of giving the [Mud Sweat and Gears](https://www.mudsweatgears.co.uk) off-road racing series a bash. My first-ever race was at Codham Park in Braintree and it was a brilliant experience. So much so I continued to enter two more rounds last year and have taken part in two rounds this year.

Turns out I might just have a competitive streak in me after all.
