There has always been something about Project Gotham Racing that I’ve loved, even when it was Metropolis Street Racer on the Dreamcast.  
The forth incarnation of the game hit the 360 last week and I picked up a copy yesterday and after a couple of hours it’s safe to say I’m pretty impressed.  
Not only do you get the standard array of supercars to drift round corners but this time there is some two wheeled fun thrown into the mix. Given my current love of motorbikes it was good to find a game with some in. MotoGP is good but too much like an arcade game, PGR4 adds a bit more simulation riding in there. It’s no Tourist Trophy that’s for certain but it does scratch that two wheeled itch.
