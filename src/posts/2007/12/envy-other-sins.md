On Friday the guvonour decided to take the afternoon off, can’t argue with that he is the boss. But when he said he was heading down to the big smoke to watch his son I was intrigued. Turns out his son is a member of an unsigned British group called [Envy & Other Sins][1] and is taking part in a competition on [C4/T4][2] for a chance for a record contract. I have not followed the [competition][3], probably because it is shown on T4 on a Sunday; some where between Friends re-runs and Hollyoaks, television I find a bit, well bllleehhh. So I’m normally out or doing something else. But the idea is that unsigned bands compete against each other for a chance to get signed and get noticed. Now don’t get this confused with another Pop Factor style of garbage, it is only for acts that are currently trying to break into the industry and already have a back catalogue of material and passion to make it. Not a one night stand solo artist that takes 12 months to put a half assed album together; my heart is fecking bleeding! Envy & Other Sins are still in the competition along with three others, todays show will see them perform a cover of their choice along side The Hoosiers, after that the judges (Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley, Blur’s Bassist Alex James and the head of A & M Records Simon Gavin) will pick two to go through to the public vote. After hearing all about this I googled the group and found their [website][4], on there you can find a few samples which put a lot of current acts to shame, pre-order the first single and find a little bit about the band. Really impressed, good luck with the competition.
