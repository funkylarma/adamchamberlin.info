Today Viddler took my online video virginity. I had purchased a Sony PC5 camcorder back in 2001 and at the time took some footage but never did anything with it. Finally, 6 years on, I’ve imported the footage into iMovie and started messing about.

Quite a bit of the footage of back in my kiting days so it was a trip down memory lane as I put together a quick tour in my lessons of learning to fly a kite.

Now came the decision on where to publish my masterpiece. Of course I could follow the herd over to youtube, but I opted to venture into [Viddler’s](http://www.viddler.com/explore/funkylarma) garden. Why? Well for one my Twitter feed is always populated with [Colin](http://cdevroe.com/) and his top notch [Viddler](http://www.viddler.com/) publicity. But also because they are showing [some promise](http://cybernetnews.com/2007/12/18/2007-cybernet-awards-best-sites-for-sharing/) and the future looks good for them.
