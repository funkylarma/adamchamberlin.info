Today Viddler took my online video virginity. I had purchased a Sony PC5 camcorder back in 2001 and at the time took some footage but never did anything with it. Finally, 6 years on, I’ve imported the footage into iMovie and started messing about.

Quite a bit of the footage of back in my kiting days so it was a trip down memory lane as I put together a quick tour in my lessons of learning to fly a kite.

Now came the decision on where to publish my masterpiece. Of course I could follow the herd over to youtube, but I opted to venture into [Viddler’s][1] garden. Why? Well for one my Twitter feed is always populated with [Colin][2] and his top notch [Viddler][3] publicity. But also because they are showing [some promise][4] and the future looks good for them.
