For a quite a while now there has been a farm of what I thought were Llama’s in the local village of Long Melford. Until one day a customer came into work and wanted some carrier bags for the produce from his [Alpaca farm](http://www.melfordgreenalpacas.co.uk/) in Melford. I soon realised my mistake and after a conversation mentioned to him of my online presence; Funky Larma (yes he too pointed out the spelling). He suggested that I pop in with my camera and take some photo’s, using them for avatars or stuff. [![Oscar](/images/2085562667_3b1c4e615d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/2085562667/ "Oscar by Funky Larma, on Flickr")Last Friday Paul popped in again for some ideas on packaging up gift certificates, interested I asked what he was planning. Turns out you can adopt an Alpaca from his flock/herd/bunch (?) and recieve updates to their progress. This was too much to pass down and so we asked if Oscar Products as a company could take part, Paul mentioned he had one male animal left to name, so we talked him into naming him Oscar. So I present [Oscar the Alpaca](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/sets/72157603369256830/). If you too feel like an Alpaca adoption is just the right gift for some one act now as the adoption programe is running up until Christmas, contact [Paul Rylott](http://www.melfordgreenalpacas.co.uk/pages/contact_us.html) for more details.
