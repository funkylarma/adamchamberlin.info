For a quite a while now, there has been a farm of what, I thought, were Llama’s in the local village of Long Melford. Until one day a customer came into work and wanted some carrier bags for the produce from his [Alpaca farm](https://www.melfordgreenalpacas.co.uk/) in Melford. I soon realised my mistake and after a conversation mentioned to him of my online presence; Funky Larma (yes he too pointed out the spelling). He suggested that I pop in with my camera and take some photo’s, using them for avatars or stuff.

Last Friday Paul popped in again for some ideas on packaging up gift certificates, interested I asked what he was planning. Turns out, you can adopt an Alpaca from his flock/herd/bunch (?) and receive updates on their progress. This was too much to pass down, and so we asked if Oscar Products as a company could take part, Paul mentioned he had one male animal left to name, so we talked him into naming him Oscar. So I present [Oscar the Alpaca](https://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/sets/72157603369256830/). If you too feel like an Alpaca adoption is just the right gift for someone, act now as the adoption programme is running up until Christmas, contact [Paul Rylott](https://www.melfordgreenalpacas.co.uk/pages/contact_us.html) for more details.
