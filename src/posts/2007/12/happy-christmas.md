For me it has been a strange old year but now it is time to put everything aside and eat and drink too much and spend time with those people that make life what it is. So have fun all and I hope Santa brings you what ever it was that has been on that list, not sure how he will get my new Yamaha R6 in the house as I have no chimney. I guess I can settle for a good meal and a glass of iced Magners!
