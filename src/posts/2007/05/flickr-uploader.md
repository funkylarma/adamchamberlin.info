On a quiet Sunday morning I was going through my photo library and uploading the ones that got left behind only to find that Flickr Uploader has been updated. Version 2.3 is now a universal binary and among other things offers growl support. There is also the ability to rate the content via a range of filters. Handy. Grab an update at the [tools page](https://www.flickr.com/tools/) of [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)
