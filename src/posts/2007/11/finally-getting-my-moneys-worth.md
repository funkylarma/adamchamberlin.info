When I look in System Preferences it now tells me I’ve been a .Mac member since 2004. Since I purchased my first Mac I have signed up to Apple’s own web service but until the last few weeks I have only ever used a .mac email address. Now armed with Leopard and an iPhone I can finally see the point in the service and have changed my work to use it more.

## Mail

First off I’m now using .Mac mail as it should be, using the magic that is IMAP I’ve moved all my mail over to Apple. Since my first [attempt][1] at using .Mac webmail they have made some improvements and it is now usable and my perfect ‘out of office’ doorway. Plus with an iPhone I am now totally connected at any time, yep Edge is not great but just being able to sit in the garden and check your mail is worth it.

## iDisc

No more [box.net][2] for me, I’m a fully fledged iDisc user now. This is only because of having a Mac at work now and the better support for iDisc in Leopard. Before then I found it flakey; dropping connections, refusing to sync and just being a pain! Now I have a local copy on both work and home machines and auto sync to keep everything where it should be. There are still a few things I would prefer but the positive point out weigh the negative. Ease people, it’s just about making things easier.

## The iLife Extras

Now you might think I will take this further with all the iLife/.Mac goodies. Sorry but no joy, I have no reason for sharing my iPhoto library; I’m [Flickr'ed][3] and that does everything I need for online photos. I do not use my camcorder nearly enough to want to share movies, I’ve not even fired up iMovie since installing iLife. iWeb is just nasty, besides why would I want to mess with that when I have my own domain and one of the most [powerful web editors][4] out there. So I will not be investing in Apple’s wholesome family fun filled sharing adventure idea. That said though for what it is worth I will gladly continue to pay for the service; now I can see the full picture. It has taken a few years but I’m glad I kept forgetting to cancel the 'auto renew’ option.
