I’m not sure if this is right or not? Lucy flew off to the States first thing Sunday morning, it is now Wednesday morning; I have run out of washing up liquid! This concerns me as I have either been acting like a responsible adult and doing the washing up on a daily basis. Or I have confused the Fairy liquid with the orange squash and now blow bubbles every time I burp. Think it is safe to say I’m scared as it looks like I’m all grown up now ;)
