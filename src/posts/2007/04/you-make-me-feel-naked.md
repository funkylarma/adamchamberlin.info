Nope, your browser is not playing tricks and worse still, my site is not yet borked. The reason for the very minimal look to the site is today's annual [CSS Naked Day](https://naked.dustindiaz.com/). Dustin set up the idea behind the [CSS Naked Day](https://naked.dustindiaz.com/) the other year, which I think I took part in if I recall correctly, anyway the idea is to stripe all the CSS from your website and display your bare code to the world. This is actually an excellent time to evaluate your site if you so desire. Well, take mine into consideration, there is no real divide between the ‘sidebar’ and the main 'content’. It would be a good idea to chuck in a HR tag in there and then just CSS it out on the design view. Anyway, I’m naked, it feels good, the sun is warm. If you require more nakedness, drop by the main site and view some more.
