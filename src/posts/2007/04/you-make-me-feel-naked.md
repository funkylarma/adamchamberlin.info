Nope your browser is not playing tricks and worse still my site is not yet borked. The reason for the very minimal look to the site is today is annual [CSS Naked Day](https://naked.dustindiaz.com/). Dustin set up the idea behind the [CSS Naked Day](https://naked.dustindiaz.com/) the other year, which I think I took part in if I remember correctly, anyway the idea is too stripe all the CSS from your web site and display your bare code to the world. This is actually a really good time to evaluate your site if you so desire. Well take mine into consideration, there is no real divide between the ‘sidebar’ and the main 'content’. It would be a good idea to chuck in a HR tag in there and then just CSS it out on the design view. Anyway, I’m naked, it feels good, the sun is warm. If you are in need of more nakedness drop by the main site and view some more.
