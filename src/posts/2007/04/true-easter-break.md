I have done it!  
I spent a day without any computer/interweb interactivity!

My plan this Easter week end was to try and distance myself from a computer screen for at least a small period of time. It just so happened to be around 36 hours and man it felt great for doing so.

I love my time on the computer and trawling the tubes for new information, my recent addiction to Twitter has made this even more enjoyable but it gets to a stage were you are just a drone clicking for kicks.

To which I decided that I would go cold turkey and just switch the G5 off. My saving grace was the fact that the weather here in Suffolk has been awesome; temperatures reaching 18 degrees centigrade and clear blue skies. So it was easy to swap my mouse for a handlebar and finally get back out on my bike. In all the sun I managed to cover just over 130 miles and see some sights that I have never viewed before; the most notable was the [Orwell Bridge][1] near Ipswich.

Now I’m back at work, in front of another computer and catching up with the Flickr feeds and Twitter posts. The peace was nice while it lasted.
