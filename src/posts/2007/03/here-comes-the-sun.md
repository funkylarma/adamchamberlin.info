Wow, what a glorious few days the East of England has had. Yesterday it read 18c and today was about 16c. It could not have come at a better time, I’ve finished my new stealth bike and managed to get a sneaky ride in this afternoon before the sun sank behind the horizon. I will be putting a run down of the bike together; honest the other window is open with a draft in there. Of course now that I’ve posted this the weather will change and there will be rain again!
