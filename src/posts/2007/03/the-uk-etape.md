> A major, unique event in the cyclosportive season, following the route of stage 1 of the Tour de France on its historic UK Grand Depart, the event will take up to 5000 riders on an epic 120 mile journey from beautiful and historic Greenwich out of London and through the Kent countryside to finish in Canterbury, in the shadow of the city’s ancient cathedral. A must-do, once-in-a-lifetime chance for any serious cyclosportive rider to blaze the trail of Le Tour itself

Sounds spectacular, doesn’t it? Lucky, I’ve got my ticket! That’s right, on July 1st I will be one of the lucky 5,000 riders to ride the same course as the Tour de France. Like the exert claims, this will be a once-in-a-lifetime ride; well, unless I try to have another go next year.
