Last night the clocks went back (Dave and I were discussing this the other day, why do we even bother with this, keep it the same time all year round) which now means that the evenings are getting even lighter. It had such a lasting effect on me that I dusted off the lawn mower and hacked the grass back this afternoon. Roll on the warmer weather and some evening cycling!
