Today is my younger brother’s; Sean’s birthday. He turned 26. After all the usual stuff you get for birthday’s these days he was given the best possible news. His partner Sarah had her 20 week scan and it looks to be he will be having a little baby daughter later in the year. I guess congratulations are in order, on both accounts. Happy birthday bro and good luck with your new journey into parenthood. I know I promised [fewer birthday posts](https://adamchamberlin.info/post/1424966648/493) but this one sort of felt important.
