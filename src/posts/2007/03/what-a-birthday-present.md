Today is my younger brother’s; Sean’s birthday. He turned 26. After all the usual stuff you get for birthday’s these days, he was given the best possible news. His partner Sarah had her 20-week scan, and it looks to be he will be having a little baby daughter later in the year. I guess congratulations are in order, on both accounts. Happy birthday, bro and good luck with your new journey into parenthood. I know I promised [fewer birthday posts](https://adamchamberlin.info/2007/02/493/) but this one sort of felt important.
