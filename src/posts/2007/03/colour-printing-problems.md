Just after Christmas, I picked up one of the new Canon Selphy printers; well, I have all these photos and nothing gets done with them. After the weekend in France, I decided to print out some better (well, in my mind) snaps. But after sending 20 odd pictures to the printer, I noticed that the colours looked rich, too rich. The blues were eye burning and the detail was lost in the lowlights and shadows. I know I have not calibrated my monitor, but the image on the screen was nowhere near the result. So Iâ€™ve been messing about with the colour settings trying to find the [right result](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/414861470_793f22d7b7.jpg).
