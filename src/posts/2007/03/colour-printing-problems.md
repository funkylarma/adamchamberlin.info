Just after Christmas I picked up one of the new Canon Selphy printers; well I have all these photo’s and nothing gets done with them. After the week end in France I decided to print out some of the better (well in my mind) snaps. But after sending 20 odd pictures to the printer I noticed that the colours looked rich, too rich. The blues were eye burning and the detail was lost in the lowlights and shadows. I know I have not calibrated my monitor but the image on the screen was no where near the end result. So I’ve been messing about with the colour settings trying to find the [right result](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/414861470_793f22d7b7.jpg).
