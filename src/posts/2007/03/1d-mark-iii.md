I think it was way back last month when I first heard the spec list for the new, revised Canon 1D camera. Engadget have finally got their [hands on one][1]. Whilst I can see the point of the Live Preview, for me it just shouts compact camera. The feature has got it’s benifits in the field but when you pay over £4,000 for a DSLR would you really use it the same way as the £30 Argos beauty.
