It was brought to my attention that I was in the local papers again [yesterday][1]. The Suffolk Free Press is a local paper that sums up all news and events locally; quite a good read actually. At the week end CCS held their anual prize giving dinner to which Rob, Dave and I were awarded the _rider of the year_ trophy for our End2End ride. Also attending the dinner was sports reported for the Suffolk Free Press; Ken Watkins, who handed out all the prizes. Of course I took my camera and you can find the photos over at [Flickr][2]
