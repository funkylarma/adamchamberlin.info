It was brought to my attention that I was in the local papers again [yesterday](https://www.sudburytoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=851&ArticleID=2003843). The Suffolk Free Press is a local paper that sums up all news and events locally; quite a good read, actually. At the weekend CCS held their annual prize giving dinner to which Rob, Dave and I were awarded the _rider of the year_ trophy for our End2End ride. Also attending the dinner was sports reported for the Suffolk Free Press; Ken Watkins, who handed out all the prizes. Of course, I took my camera, and you can find the photos over at [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/sets/72157594507048428/)
