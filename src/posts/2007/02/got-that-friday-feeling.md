Ok it’s Friday, in fact it’s Friday evening and I really have that great feeling inside. Of course you always get that feeling when you leave work ready for the week end but there is an extra reason for my \_buzzy'ness\_… Right now Lucy should be boarding a plane in [Raleigh][1] on her way back home. It has been a slow last two weeks but I am really looking forward to seeing Lucy again, gonna be a great day tomorrow.
