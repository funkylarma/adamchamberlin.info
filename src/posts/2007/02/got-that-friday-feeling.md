OK, it’s Friday. In fact, it’s Friday evening and I really have that great feeling inside. Of course, you always get that feeling when you leave work ready for the weekend, but there is an extra reason for my \_buzzy'ness\_… Currently, Lucy should be boarding a plane in [Raleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh%2C_North_Carolina) on her way back home. It has been a slow last two weeks, but I am really looking forward to seeing Lucy again, going to be a great day tomorrow.
