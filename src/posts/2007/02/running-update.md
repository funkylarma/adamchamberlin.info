Last night I had another quick trip [round the block](http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/?l=mapit,1690290893) and so far it has tipped my total just over the 100km mark. I’m happy with my progress so far, I’ve not been out much in the last week or so but this is more to do with a busy schedule rather than a lack of commitment.
