I’ve just realised if it was not for birthdays this place would be very quiet. The last few posts have all been about birthdays, but this years is full of important dates; my dad’s 60th, my 30th, a few 25’s a handful of 21’s and a 10th! Hopefully I’ll rack my brains and try and come up with something interesting to write in-between the birthday posts.
