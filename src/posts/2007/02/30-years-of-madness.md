This week end marked a significant page in the diary. Saturday was Lucy’s brother; Ant, his 30th birthday. Of course this meant there would be some celebrating in only a way that Ant knows, too much beer but no one really expected an X-Rated lap dance with a cement mixer. To kick the party off with a touch of class it was formal wear only, Ant of course went one step further and donned a white tux, making him look like a rough mix of The Godfather and a tubby James Bond. The next step was the venue, the Corn Exchange in Stamford, which was host to Ant and Charlottes wedding reception a few years back. The stage was set, the lights were low and flashy and the guests began to arrive. Bar staff were warned that it could be a boozy night and that there is a good chance we will out drink the place so stay well stocked. It did not work, they ran out of: beer, vodka and coke. One of the highlights for me (apart from the cement mixer dance; later I tell you) was an awesome 30minute set by Richard. Playing an acoustic guitar he ran through a medley of number one hits from the last thirty years. There was everything in there and performed perfectly, if you ever wanted a personal gift that was it.

After this came the grand prize giving, hosted by Paul there was a quick round of singing and then the standard birthday cake. After this was a presentation by Phil with a gift from the boys; a brandy decanter with matching silver tag. The tag was engraved with the message _Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo_ (I will leave you to google for the translation). Finally it was time for the ‘big one’, most people had chipped in to purchase the man a new cement mixer! Well what says 'I love you’ more than a giant orange petrol powered machine? To say that Ant was happy to recieve this present was an understatment, all party goers were then subject to a 3minute 'love’ ritual as Ant got accustomend to his new toy, in some places too accustomed. Happy Birthday Old Boy!
