This weekend marked a significant page in the diary. Saturday was Lucy’s brother; Ant, his 30th birthday. Of course, this meant there would be some celebrating in only a way that Ant knows, too much beer, but no one really expected an X-Rated lap dance with a cement mixer. To kick the party off with a touch of class, it was formal wear only, Ant, of course, went one step further and donned a white tux, making him look like a rough mix of The Godfather and a tubby James Bond. The next step was the venue, the Corn Exchange in Stamford, which was host to Ant and Charlottes wedding reception a few years back. The stage was set, the lights were low and flashy and the guests began to arrive. Bar staff were warned that it could be a boozy night and that there is a good chance we will out drink the place so stay well stocked. It did not work, they ran out of beer, vodka, and coke. One of the highlights for me (apart from the cement mixer dance; later I tell you) was a remarkable 30minute set by Richard. Playing an acoustic guitar, he ran through a medley of number one hits from the last thirty years. There was everything in there and performed perfectly, if you ever wanted a personal gift, that was it.

After this came the grand prize giving, hosted by Paul. There was a quick round of singing and then the standard birthday cake. After this was a presentation by Phil with a gift from the boys; a brandy decanter with matching silver tag. The tag was engraved with the message _Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo_ (I will leave you to google for the translation). Finally, it was time for the ‘big one’, most people had chipped in to purchase the man a new cement mixer! Well, what says 'I love you’ more than a giant orange petrol-powered machine? To say that Ant was happy to receive this present was an understatement, all party goers were then subject to a 3minute 'love’ ritual as Ant got accustomed to his new toy, in some places too accustomed. Happy Birthday, Old Boy!
