Rob called me this morning to let me know that he got wind of a recall notice on all SRAM Force brakesets.

Apparently the titanium used in the mounting bolts is not right which can lead to failure of the unit, I checked the SRAM website and yes everything is [going back](https://www.sram.com/en/newsandevents/racingnews.php?newsID=577bcc914f9e55d5e4e4f82f9f00e7d4).

Just take a wild guess as to what brakes I’m fitting on my stealth project (more details on this later) you got it; Force!  
Oh well I can’t go any further until the rest of the bike has been delivered anyway.
