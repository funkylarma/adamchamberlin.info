Yep I’m just another web2.0 sheep; following the herd and signing up to the latest trend site and social networking community. If you check your radar the current must have invites are for [Plasq Skitch][1] and [Pownce][2]. Plasq Skitch enables you to captre and share screen grabs and images with ease Pownce is the new social networking site that looks to take some of Twitters thunder. Thanks to [Luxury Luke][3] and [Brendan][4] I have invites available for both developments. If you need a web2.0 fix drop me a line and I’ll see what I can do
