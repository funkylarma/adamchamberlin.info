Is is just a fade or will this be the start of a fitness regime? Michael over at [Binary Bonsai](http://binarybonsai.com/) started this off with his [Zero2Hero](http://binarybonsai.com/tag/zero2hero) idea; get running and get fit. I knew that since the Autumn I have been letting myself go and some time soon I would need to get back into shape. It just seemed like too good a opportunity to miss so I jumped on the bandwagon and decided to shape up. Last week end I cut out the smokes; yes I know I’ve done that before but over Christmas one thing lead to another and one drink lead to another session of smoking like a chimney! This week end I bit the bullet and went out to purchase a [Nike+](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/nike/) setup. If you are not aware of the Nike+ thing it is a rather clever little partnership of Nike and Apple to get people out and running. The idea basically is a pedometer that records all your activity. The Nike+ kit consists of a small pedometer and a reciever that fits into the bottom of your iPod Nano. So other equipment that is required is a iPod Nano for a start and if you are feeling ultra cool a pair of Nike+ compatible trainers. The Nike+ trainers are nothing amazingly special, they are simply a pair of trainers with a little recess for the transmitter pedometer under the inner sole. There are other ways of securing your Nike+ pedometer to standard trainers, including just hacking hell out of a pair of shoes.

### So how does this all work then?

Well it’s quite simple in effect, you have a pedometer in your shoes which transmits the movement via RFID (yes you could possible be [transmitting](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,72202-0.html) your location blah blah blah) to the reciever on your iPod. When you first connect your iPod it installs an extra menu for Nike+iPod which lets you calibrate your sensor, or create work outs. When your ready you click the work out your require; basic, time, distance or calories burnt, then select your play list and off you go. Each step is recorded and sent to the iPod where a running total is calculated. By clicking the centre button at any time will give you a run down so far of your progress. Upon completion of your run you connect and sync your iPod and your current run is sent to [nikeplus.com](http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/)where it will plot your run with all the data collected. From here you can create goals to keep you going or set challenges with other Nike+ users to keep you motivated.

### Does it work in the real life?

[![My First Nike+ Run](images/356163579_4e5249d1c3_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkylarma/356163579/)

So far it is awesome! I have not run for some years now and to be honest when I did it was never really through choice. Just the edition of having music whilst you run is a great help, add to this the fact that you know every step is being recorded sort of pushes you on. For my first run I set about making up a decent play list. I sprinkled some [Tangerine](http://www.potionfactory.com/tangerine/)love on my iTunes library and created an upbeat playlist. Blammed this over to the pod and set off. This really helped as everything that came on had a good bpm and whenever the legs started to give way you could just drift into a state of music and beat induced karma. The ability to quickly check on your progress was great. On the first leg out of the town, which was a nice downhill, downwind trot I picked up a nice pace. Yet to the return I could keep track of my pace and knew I needed to dig deep to keep that average up! If you want to start running but lack the enthusiasm this is a great way to do it. The fact that you are in effect competing with your self is such a motivator that you will keep going out and trying to beat your personal best.

### The Future

To keep you going Michael has set up the [Zero2Hero Locker Room](http://www.flickr.com/groups/87184948@N00/) over at Flickr. A place for like minded Nike+ and general non-geeky runners to meet and set up challenges and compare blisters! It is also a good place to post those screen shots of your latest run.
