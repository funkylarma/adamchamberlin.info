Over the last few days I have been working on a new web application for the Intranet at work. The idea of the app was to able to input and store quotation requests from potential customers. Part of this information collected is the postal address of the client, to which I decided it would be easier to have the UK counties as a drop down box; saves the spelling mistakes as not many people live in Esesx. Having spent the morning creating this drop down box I thought it would be a waste to have it just sitting on an Intranet some where hidden from the world. To which I have bundled together a quick zip file with the drop down list code. Grab a copy [here](http://media.stourvalleydesigns.com/shibbyonline/counties.zip)
