It is January which means only one thing MacExpo! The time of year were Mr. Jobs shocks the world with just ‘one more thing’. This year there was no exception just a slight change in the proceedings. There was no last minute shocker, it was full blown shock from the outset. First up we have [AppleTV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/) or iTV as it was nick named. This is a clever streaming media device that will sit under your hi def TV and stream movies, music, photos and other such media treats from up to 5 machines. Very clever me thinks but I’ll wait to see if it will stream Aperture libraries until I get too excited. Second shock, the fabled iPhone. After [Cisco released](http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/18/cisco-not-apple-announces-iphone-branded-voip-phones/) a wifi phone labeled iPhone I thought it was the end of the rumour mill for Apple. Yet Steve manages to pull one out of the bag, a wide screen, touch enabled iPod with phone capabilities! (Now thats a gadget to behold) The [Apple iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) has not passed FCC approval and so will not be on sale or advertised as being so until it does but the Keynote indicated prices of around $499 for the 8gb phone and a two year contract.
