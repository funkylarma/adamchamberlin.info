Lets be honest the Nike+ thing is a fitness for geeks tool. Yet why is it sooooo compeling? I took part in my first run on Saturday night and all of a sudden I was top of the leader board for the current challenge over at the [Zero2Hero Locker Room][1]. However in my over enthusisastic why I pushed it too hard on the first day, then followed this up with 30miles on the bike Sunday morning and now my legs are really begining to feel the pain. Yet since then Ive now lost my lead, what am I to do? Do I run the risk of putting myself in bed for the next couple of days just to claw back the top place. Or do I let this one go and catch up later on? This is more frustrating than trying to complete Gears Of War on insane difficulty!
