I finally have my phone back. Itâ€™s only been just over a week but those were some long days. I think the most missed feature was the camera, I can do without the phone calls, I can also just about survive without texting updates to Twitter but I really did miss having a camera in my pocket. The good news is that o2 did update and flash the newest firmware on the phone whilst they were at it.
