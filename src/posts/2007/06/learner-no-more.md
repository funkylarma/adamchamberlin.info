Congratulations to Lucy! This morning she passed her driving test. It was her second attempt and only scored a total of 4 minor faults was a very good pass. Her first attempt last month probably should have been a pass as she was only failed due to a ‘judgement’ error, not leaving enough room for a parked car on a busy two way street. Find me a driver who does these days. Anyway she has passed now and the L plates have been put away for now… This does mean that she can finally use the Beetle she bought last year, but more importantly I can be driven around places and enjoy a life of passenger seat luxury!
