Yesterday was the first part of my motorcycling adventure; the CBT. CBT ([Compulsary Basic Training][1]) is a standard you must achieve before you can ride a motorbike on the road in the UK. Thanks to Ian and Ivan at [Excel Rider Training][2] who made the day; despite the weather! The next step to to practice my theory and hazard perception tests, then book a theory and see where we go. Until then I could look into the purchase of a 125cc bike and ride on the road with the L plates.
