Yesterday was the first part of my motorcycling adventure; the CBT. CBT ([Compulsory Basic Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_Basic_Training)) is a standard you must achieve before you can ride a motorbike on the road in the UK. Thanks to Ian and Ivan at [Excel Rider Training](https://www.excelmotorcycletraining.co.uk/) who made the day; despite the weather! The next step to practice my theory and hazard perception tests, then book a theory and see where we go. Until then, I could look into the purchase of a 125cc bike and ride on the road with the L plates.
