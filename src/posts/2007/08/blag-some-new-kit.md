Online cycle shop [Wiggle](http://www.wiggle.co.uk) are running a competition at the moment where they are giving away a full [Shimano XT groupset](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/range.aspx?n=Shimano-XT-2008-bike-components&Range=25). All you have to do is tell them why you dersve it over all overs. Here is my excuse:

> I think I deserve a new XT groupset as my bike needs one badly and I’ve begged the other half but I can’t buy anything new until she has her wisdom teeth out. So I’m having to ride around using a worn XT which really doesn’t know what gear it wants to be in! And she thinks she is in pain!

My Marin has been running the same setup since purchase and the 4k miles I’ve put on it are beginning to show. Of course I’ve done the usual chain replace but now everything is showing signs of giving out on me. Yet me bike fund will be dipped into since Lucy visited the dentist to find out that the remaining wisdom teeth need removing! I think if you want to enter the competition you need to sign up to Wiggle’s newsletter and set up an account, of course making a purchase might help.
