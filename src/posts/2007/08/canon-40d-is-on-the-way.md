In the last 24 hours or so details of Canon’s replacement for the 30D has been unveiled.  
It started with Amazon ‘accidentally’ putting the page live of their site, then counter details were released across the tubes.

I for one use Digital Photography Review as my source of all things Photography based, so when I see it there I start believing. [Whoot!](https://www.dpreview.com/news/0708/07082010canoneos40d.asp)

Given that I only upgraded camera body in the last [six months](https://adamchamberlin.info/post/1424972962/camera-upgrade) am I excited or concerned?  
To be honest no, I have not even touched the surface of what the 30D can do for me and despite the spec’s of the 40D looking awesome I do not think I could do it justice just yet. But if you have a demo rig going spare I’ll happily test it out for you.
