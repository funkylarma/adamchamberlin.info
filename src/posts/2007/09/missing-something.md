Look through your feeds, notice something missing?

Yep, I’ve been elsewhere the last few days. Understandable if you had [this](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1028/1332849402_bf7e2d0c03.jpg) parked outside!
It all started last week, having [ordered the bike](https://adamchamberlin.info/2007/08/the-test-ride) I was getting like a school boy at Christmas, I could not concentrate on anything and was turned upside down.

Finally, Monday the 3rd arrived and I set off to collect my new machine. Since then, I have been out and about, riding my way through to the first service; I’m 115 miles into the 600mile deadline.

Let’s be honest, or rather I had better be honest with myself, as long as the weather holds and the sun shines I think I will be out there expanding my skills. And when not I’ll be over at the [FZ6 forum](https://www.fz6-forum.com/) catching up with other riders from around the globe.
