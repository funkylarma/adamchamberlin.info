This Monday it will be October 1st, the year feels like it is flying away. Once again this year shibbyonline will be going [PinkForOctober](http://pinkforoctober.org/) in aid of breast cancer awareness. Given that Jacqui is back in hospital at present for further surgery it feels the right time to show some support. But thatâ€™s not all on the 15th I will also be taking part in [Blog Action Day](http://www.blogactionday.org/). This is an idea that multiple blogs launch a mass posting on environmental issues, I guess hoping that there is power in the masses. In the last few months I have had a thorn in my side about plastic bags and the eco-friendly brigade, I think this might be the right time to write something up on it.
