Talk about a long time coming. Looking back the last time I sat down with digits at keyboard was over three years ago, that is quite a while in Internet time.

Well since that time I’ve changed jobs, bought a house and started a family. Maybe taking time out is good for the soul, it has helped me.

However I have missed having that little outlet for my thoughts, the online scratch book so to speak. But life has changed and so should this blog, hence why it is now hosted on Tumblr. Whilst I enjoy trying to write the need for a medium that caters for quick updates is more important; plus it’s good to try something different.  
So expect a different format and hopefully a few more updates.
