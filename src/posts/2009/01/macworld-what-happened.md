I love all Mac related events, it’s a time that new shiney gadgets are unveiled and I work out how I can purchase them. This years Macworld event started off with the shock of Apple pulling out and the main man Steve not performing another _Steve-note_. But nothing compared to the actual event! Let’s sum it up: iLife, iWork, iTunes DRM free and 17" MacBook Pro. Honestly I do use iWork so I’m interested in that, not sure if web sharing is as cutting egde as they think. Just don’t build it on iDisk foundations! But come on, is that it. Where is the updated Mac Mini, cinema screens, iMac revisions, the excitement! I was really looking forward to a AppleTV related ‘one more thing’ but alas nothing. Steve was right to spend the time with his family.
