The British gravel scene is coming of age and it would appear that Glorious Gravel is trying to be the Lifetime to the discipline.

They are putting on the [British Gravel Trophy Series](https://britishgraveltrophy.com) which is six rounds in 2026 throughout the UK. Ok, not quite the Lifetime GP and given that six round will take place over three venues you have to keep your enthusiasms in check.
Hey, it is a start and at least there are some events to take part in.
