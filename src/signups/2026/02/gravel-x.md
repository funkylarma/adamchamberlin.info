Kicking 2026 off with a gravel event. Not a race but I hear there are numbers so I'm guessing it will be the same as a cyclo sportive; willy waggling at the front and a lot of ego's to keep in check.

It is the perfect way to get my eye in for next weeks event at [Sherwood Pines](http://adamchamberlin.info/2026/02/sherwood-tropy/)
