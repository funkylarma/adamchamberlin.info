Welcome to Freetrail's coverage of the 2025 Tarawera by UTMB! Set against the beautiful backdrop of Rotorua, NZ, an outdoor and trail sport mecca known for its rolling hills, thermal pools, and beautiful lakes, Tarawera plays host to four different race distances â€” 100m, 102k, 50k, & 21k. Thanks to HOKA for supporting the show!
