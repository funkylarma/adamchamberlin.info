Oura Ring has become a leader in personal health tracking with its advanced, discreet technology. It goes beyond basic step counting, delving deep into sleep analysis, heart rate variability (HRV), temperature trends, and more than 30 other biometrics.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Oura Ring 4 represents the pinnacle of wearable health technology, integrating advanced sensors, proprietary algorithms, and real-time data analysis into a comfortable ring form-factor to deliver highly accurate and continuous health insights.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Learn more about the cutting-edge technology that powers Oura Ring 4—which, in turn, empowers Oura members to take control of their health and wellbeing.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Sleeker. Smarter. Made for you.⁠⁠⁠⁠ Shop Oura Ring 4⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Advanced Sensor Suite⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Oura Ring 4 features a completely redesigned multi-sensor system, offering unparalleled accuracy.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ 18-path multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG):⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Red and infrared LEDs measure blood oxygen levels (SpO2) while you sleep.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Green and infrared LEDs track heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) 24/7, as well as respiration rate during sleep.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Digital temperature sensor: measures skin temperature variations for early signs of sickness, menstrual cycle tracking, and recovery insights.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ 3D accelerometer: monitors movement and activity 24/7, capturing steps, exercise intensity, and nighttime restlessness.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Groundbreaking Smart Sensing technology: dynamically adjusts sensor path activation based on activity levels, significantly improving signal fidelity and battery efficiency.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Proprietary Algorithms for Data Analysis⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ The research-grade sensors power machine-learning algorithms to deliver the most accurate, continuous data, day and night—all while optimizing battery life.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Algorithms adapt to your personal baseline, adjusting contributors to your Sleep, Activity, and Readiness Scores over time.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Oura’s advanced machine-learning-based sleep staging algorithm has been scientifically validated against polysomnography (PSG)—the gold standard of sleep tracking—allowing it to generate precise sleep stage graphs (hypnograms).⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Automatic Activity Detection (AAD) intelligently detects 40+ workouts without manual input, delivering average heart rate and heart rate zones after the activity.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Smart Sensing reduces data gaps, leading to a 31% improvement in nighttime heart rate tracking and a 7% improvement in daytime heart rate accuracy.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ RELATED: Technology in Oura Ring Gen3⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Bluetooth Connectivity⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ The bluetooth technology in Oura Ring is only active during a small portion (well below 1%) of each day. Data is transmitted more continuously when the ring syncs with the app and during firmware updates.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ The limit for SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) for a device such as Oura Ring is 2.0 W/kg for head and body, and Oura’s SAR level is 0.0003 W/kg. In other words, the EMF levels of the ring are about 3,000 times lower than a typical smartphone.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Member Tip: Activate Airplane Mode if you prefer to eliminate all EMF exposure from your ring. Keep in mind that Bluetooth is only active in Oura Ring during a small portion of each day, falling well below 1%.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Dimensions and Weight⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Width: 7.90 mm⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Thickness: 2.88mm⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Weight Range: 3.3 — 5.2 g for full range of sizes 4 — 15⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Water Resistance⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Water resistant to 100m/328ft⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Battery⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Up to 8 days of battery life\*⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Typically charges fully in 20-80 minutes, depending on the battery level⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Lithium-ion rechargeable battery⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ LEARN MORE: Ring Battery Tips⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ \*All battery claims depend on Oura Ring size, Oura App settings, feature configuration, activity, age of battery, usage, and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. Battery tests were conducted across various sizes and scenarios.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ The post Explore the Technology in Oura Ring 4 appeared first on The Pulse Blog.
