**Update:** Fitted the 170 mm crank and had my first training session last night, today I’m feeling a bit better and the knee feels more confident, but I guess it will take a few more days to really show.

For the last few weeks, I’ve been riding and training on a Trek1400 road bike. I picked this up to break into the road scene and put a few more miles on the clock. It was not quite the specification I was looking for; it has a tripe chain-set instead of a double, but then you could not quibble at the price! I’m not sure which came first, but for the last few weeks I’ve also been suffering from an extended tendon at the back of my knee. When on a bike, I feel fine and never really worries me, but after a ride my leg just will not straighten out and causes some really horrible pains at times, I put it down to a incorrect seat height, so I adjusted it. Better but still, there!

Over the weekend I was giving the Trek a service and thought about switching that triple for a double when I noticed something on the crank arms, there are 175 mm cranks. The standard cranks for the everyday joe are a 170 mm, but these are 5 mm more, not much you might say, but I would put these down to increasing the pains in my knee. One Shimano 170 mm double chain-set on its way.
