There was always going to be the feeling of not being complete with an Apple mouse. It only has one button after all! Windows users have been using two buttons for years and even the extreme of 6 buttons and yaw control and stabilisers and all other pretty functions. Yes you can attach a two button mouse to your Mac but then you lose that wonderful white scheme which to mean is one of the best features of being a Mac user. (To be picky I do use a S+ARCK mouse anyway) So to my delight I give you the Mac [Mighty Mouse](https://www.apple.com/mightymouse/)
