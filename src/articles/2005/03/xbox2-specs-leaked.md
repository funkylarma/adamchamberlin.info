Microsoft’s second version of its Xbox console will feature a CPU with PowerPC cores, according to [GameSpy][1], which claims to have scooped the specifications.

I heard rumours of a PowerPC chip behind this machine many moons ago but decided not to believe the hype until confirmed. I’m still not convinced this is a 100% waterproof M$ approved spec sheet, so here’s to still holding your breath.
