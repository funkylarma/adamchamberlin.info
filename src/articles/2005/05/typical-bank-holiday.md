Just wondering whether everybody has had a nice summer? That was it you know, the three days of lovely sunshine! The time when everybody, including me, got the sun lounges out, filled there eyes with bbq smoke, filled there bellies with the charcoal they cremated on the top and then got burnt by the sun and spent all the next day walking round trying not to touch anything!

The point I was getting to, was that after three or four days of lovely weather, as soon as it is bank holiday Monday, we had rain, lightning, thunder and all sorts of dreadful weather. Now the bank holiday has passed, the sun is out again, and blow me down, iâ€™m gonna grab the deck chair and brush up on my tong skills, i feel like burning something outside!!!
