One of three Friday nights for me are a bit of a non-event, Lucy is at work, and so I have no real intention of doing anything, usually this is used to perform the regular maintenance on this site and the DAO one. This Friday was a bit different, I got a call from Dan who wanted to try an installation of Linux, so with my Mandrake discs in hand I popped round to see what I could do. Well, one thing lead to another and someone mentioned beer and wine might ease my back, I have no idea if the pizza would really help but what the hell worth a shot.

The main man Dan and I sat there for hours, putting the world to rights, deciding what colour is best for this coming Thursday, oh and having a quick tour back to the eighties and remembering the days of British Knights and school disco’s!

The night would not be the same without the woman indoors (you know I don’t mean it.
