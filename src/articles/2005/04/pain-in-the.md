Back!  
I wish I knew what I have done but at present I’m crippled, OK not that bad but a serious amount of pain and not thoroughly enjoying it too much. 

It all started the other morning I think, lifting a PC into the boot of the car, I must have turned and done something weird with it as it just felt ‘off’ since then. But on the way home on the bike last night I went to put the power down out of a junction and I left something tear in my back. So much so that within 50 meters of the junction I was in a pile on the grass on the side of the road.
