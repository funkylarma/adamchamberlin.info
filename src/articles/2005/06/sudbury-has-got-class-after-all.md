I was cycling home tonight and the usual trip down Market Hill yields the standard array of new Focus’, welded together Rover’s and the fibre-glass improved chav mobiles but something caught my eye this time. So much so I had to stop and double take.

Yes, the Aero8 is a little weird for some people and yes, from the front it does look a bit bug eyed, but for me, it was just something to behold.
