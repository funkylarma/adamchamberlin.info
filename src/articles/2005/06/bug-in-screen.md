Last night whilst I was trying to take several more photos of the ongoing storm that has not really stopped for two days now, Bob was looking at his new site on a Mac to check it worked in Safari when he commented on a ‘spot’ on my screen. On closer inspection, it turns out that it is not a bit of dirt on the screen but a spot inside the screen. We sat there trying to work out what it was when the bit of dirt started moving!

Suddenly, we realised what was going on, in all the storms it had brought out the favourite bug of everyone, the 'Thunder-bug’ you know those little black flies that get everywhere, I mean everywhere!

I’m not really sure what to do about it, I’m certain that Apple does not cover insect invasion in their warranty and I cannot imagine shelling out too much money to get it sorted, well, not at present with current situations anyway. I guess I could wait for it to die and fall out, Bob suggested sending in a bigger bug to eat the smaller one, thanks!
