Ah, the old days of the Commodore 64, long lazy summers, long loading games, every game release was wonderful and games were only £8.95 (£7.95 on spectrum — not fair).

Anyway on to the post, I found an absolute class site the other day which has some excellent remakes of some old Commodore 64 classics, one of the highlights on this page is a pc remake of monty on the run, it's perfect, graphics are pretty decent and the old soundtrack is still there, also on this site are some other old favourites including remakes of jet set willy.

Clicking on the link below will whisk you away to remake land, enjoy!!!!
