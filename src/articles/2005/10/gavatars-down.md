[K2](https://binarybonasi.com/wordpress/ks/) has the built-in features for [gravatar](https://www.gravatar.com)’s. To be honest, when I first saw them I thought of it more as a gimmick rather than a useful plugin, but now looking at the whole scheme of the idea I realised it is so simple yet so effective!  

I’ve spent the last couple of days thinking the idea over. I decided I would give it a crack, but looking at the site, Tom Werner is having a few problems. Now we have a problem, I wanted something and I can’t have it, now I _need_ it!
