Last night I went to my first meeting of the Sudbury Cycle Club.  
Since I have been doing a load more road miles and making up some training programmes Lucy has been on at me to get in contact with her work friend; Brian who helps out at the local club. I finally paid up and joined on the Tuesday and was invited to their AGM on Thursday night. I went along and by the end of it I’m now the newsletter editor! How and why do I lead myself into these situations. Next time some asks we need… just learn the values of silence.  

This should be quite a laugh as the role does not start till 2006 and I have a ‘free control’ over the creativity of the publication.
