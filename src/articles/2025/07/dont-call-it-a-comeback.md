It has been a fair few years since I have taken part in a competitive cycling event. Last Thursday I broke the drought by signing on to the Cycle Club Sudbury evening time trial.

Nothing quite like a club ten to make your eyes water and get that metallic taste in your mouth.

The rules have changed a bit since I last pinned on a number, you can now race in a dedicated road bike category; which I did.
End time for the course was 23:52, which I'm very happy with given the time off.

Must give a hat tip to [Benson Ho](https://bhp328.mypixieset.com/) for the photographs from the night.
