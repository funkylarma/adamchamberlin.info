Mozilla announced the other day the next release in the all-in-one package; [Seamonkey](https://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/).

The software includes just about everything you need to get started on an adventure into the inter-web; web browser, email, IRC client, even an HTML editor to get you building websites.
