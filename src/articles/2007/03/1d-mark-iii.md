I think it was way back last month when I first heard the spec list for the new, revised Canon 1D camera. Engadget have finally got their [hands on one](https://www.engadget.com/2007/03/08/hands-on-with-canons-eos-1d-mark-iii-dslr/). Whilst I can see the point of the Live Preview, for me, it just shouts compact camera. The feature has got its benefits in the field, but when you pay over £4,000 for a DSLR would you really use it the same way as the £30 Argos beauty.
