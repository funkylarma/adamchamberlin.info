This year’s Tour is off to a great start, especially given [last years mess](https://adamchamberlin.info/2006/06/last-minute-shake-up/). The Prologue was off to a great start, Britain’s hope was in the form of David Millar and Bradley Wiggins. Personally, I doubted that either of them would be wearing the yellow at the end of the day, but I really did not think that Fabian Cancellara would smash the field wide open by 15 seconds! Stage 1 definitely belonged to the Brits, David Millar set out from the start to clock up the miles in front of the home crowd. Of course, no matter how much you try, you cannot expect to finish first after a 200 km break away. But Mr. Millar put on that classic British stiff upper lip and led the way for around 150 km; securing him the polka dot jersey. Let’s just hope that now the Tour has hit its home shores that everything will go smoothly, and we can have a _clean_ year without any bans or doping scandal’s.
