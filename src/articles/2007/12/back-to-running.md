With the nights getting darker and the days colder, I’m not getting out on my bike so much. So I dug out my iPod and Nike+ sensor and decided to hit the tarmac again. After a few quick runs around the block, I knew I needed a bit of motivation to keep on track, so I started browsing the Challenge gallery on the [Nike+](https://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/) webmetadata. The first one I clicked onto was the PC vs. Mac; well, I just had to and no points for guessing the side I picked. But the second challenge I found looked interesting; ’[Run Supersonic vs The World](https://www.myspace.com/NikeSupersonic)’

> On 17 November London’s fastest 1000 proved their speed at Nike+ Supersonic: a 1K Sprint Speedway fuelled by live performances from Dizzee Rascal and The Enemy - see it at nikesupersonic.com. The final is over. The race has just begun. Whoever logs the fastest 1K before 5 January ‘08 wins an exclusive music prize. Will London retain its Supersonic crown?

It actually had a purpose, so I, like 490 other people, joined up. Since then, I’ve not focused on it, just doing my simple runs and letting iTunes work out my best 1 km. Having submitted a few runs, I decided to check the leaderboards; hell yeah I’m 17th!
