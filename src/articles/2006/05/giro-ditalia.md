Some of you might know of a little cycle race going on currently; the Giro d’Ilaila. For those that don’t here is a quick re-cap; imagine the Tour de France in Italy. Simple really, well, that is the simple version.

I’ve not been following this as closely as I would like, but I caught up with the results after the Stage 11 Time Trial. Since Lance departed from racing last year, there was a big ‘who’s the next yellow jersey contender’ question. My money was to be put on either Ivan Basso or Tom Boonen. You could see it in Basso during last year’s Tour, he put up a fight to the end and so far, this year he is proving to be a winner. He has led the Giro most of the way so far and does appear to be looking back. Boonen, on the other hand, has been on a winning streak all year, apart from the [Paris-Roubaix](https://adamchamberlin.info/2006/04/paris-roubaix/), but just not sure if he is Tour leader material yet. The results of the Time Trial did indicate one thing, big Jan is not out of the race. Well, he is out of the race in the Giro, sitting in the mid-40’s, but he still has it in him to compete.
