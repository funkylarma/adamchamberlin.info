Reading through the news, I came across [this](https://www.bikemagic.com/) article from [BikeMagic](https://www.bikemagic.com/) about the new Giant Glory downhill machine. For one, it is a stunning colour and the components are pretty nifty, but just look at [this](https://www.bikemagic.com/) picture of the gusset work and link detail. I used to ride a Box One many moons ago and this just takes me back.
