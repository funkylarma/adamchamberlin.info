I was hoping for a nice quiet day at work; following up some leads and looking into some more asbestos rules and regulations, however a phone call from OZ meant Iâ€™m spending the day coding the [company][1] web metadata.

Just what I need after spending my spare working this metadata. I need a break, I just nested a div tag within an a tag; what was I thinking!
