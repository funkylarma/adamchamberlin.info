To say I was not [impressed](https://adamchamberlin.info/2006/03/se-can-kiss-my-ass/) by Sony Ericsson’s service was a bit of an understatement, so I decided to try to sort my phone out myself.
After a quick google I found out that the people in the know are the [DaVinciTeam](https://davinciteam.com/) who specialise in SE mods and firmware updates. A bit of researching I found that using the standard USB cable and the DaVinci client software I can re-flash my phone; hopefully into a working one!

Be warned, this process does nothing for your warrenty and does not promise to leave you with a working phone, but as my was dead already, I opted for the ‘what the hell’ option. Instead of just flashing my phone I tried an update to the W800i firmware, what do you know I now have a working phone again!

The W800i interface looks much the same with the addition of a music player; not really going to leave my iPod at home just yet. The phone does feel a bit quicker and the display sharper, and it has not dropped the memory stick yet.
