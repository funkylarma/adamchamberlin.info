Today is the first day of Spring, well, according to the not so risky calendar in my office, I miss dirty work environments with dirty calendars, I mean how much does she really know about pneumatics and that cannot be Union issued work ware.

Sorry, any way back to the point of this. It should be the first day of Spring, but does it feel like Spring?  
Not quite, the weather is still brisk with the odd flake of snow trying to fall. We are on the homeward stretch of March and there are traces of snow in the air, not really spring like weather to me.

I could really just do with a change, some warmer weather just to shake off those wintry blues and brighten up the outlook. Come on 2006, let's see some sun.
