It is a little later than planned, but here is the new theme/style for [shibbyonline](https://adamchamberlin.info/ 'shibbyonline'). Code named _Black_ it is the first theme I have created using a dark background, those of you who have followed my themes and designed will know that it is mainly light colours that float my boat. There are still little bugs to work out, and Iâ€™m in the process of writing new archive and about pages, but hopefully, once completed it might make its way to a release.
