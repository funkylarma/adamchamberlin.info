I am now sitting in a Travel Inn in Hayle and, to be honest, I’m feeling a lot better than I was yesterday.

It has been a long old drive just to get here and so far, the weather has been great. We shot straight down to Land's End and had a photo taken, turns out the official photographer does not start until 10 in the morning; by which time we wanted to be 3 hours down the road. So a bit of smooth talking, and we got tomorrow’s date on the sign and will try and blag the rest.

Of course, I’m still nervous as hell about what is going to happen in the morning, but with the weather being so great it is difficult to not wear a smile and look forward to the ride; despite seeing some of those rolling hills on the way here!
