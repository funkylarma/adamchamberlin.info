 <!-- [![Cycle Show][image-1]][1] -->
This year's [cycle show](https://www.cycleshow.co.uk/) is being held on the 5th to the 8th October at the ExCel centre in London. Thursday the 5th is trade only, but the remaining days are open to the public. See all the latest toys and goodies from the biggest makes. Anyone interested in going? Sorry for yet another cycling related entry!
