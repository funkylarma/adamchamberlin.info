This evening I took a trip to the local PC World to pick up some blank DVDs for a project, I also wanted to have a look at some microphones for Skype. Ended up walking out with a Wacom tablet instead. Strange, I thought. A graphics tablet has been on my list for a while, but I’ve never got around to getting one, until I found this one sitting there on special offer. It would have been wrong to ignore it. I’ve installed the software which also puts Inkwell on my Mac and so far, it looks good, think I better get out there and take a few photos to start messing about with them.
