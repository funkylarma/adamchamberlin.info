Joe posted his [webmentions page](https://lab.artlung.com/webmentions/) in the IndieWeb chat and it prompted me to try and finally check the other side of webmentions.

It was not the most simple but with the help of [James](https://jamesg.blog/2020/09/04/how-i-use-webmentions/) and [Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/30/11/your-first-webmention) I think I have managed to get some reply-to notes set up.
