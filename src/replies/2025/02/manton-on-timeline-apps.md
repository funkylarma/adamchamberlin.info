I really want to be able to use a single feed to scroll through and comment or like as needed. It would also be great if I could share my timeline status.

Right now Iâ€™m scrolling through all the content on Reeder but then I have to go back and to Classic and make as read, then switch to Ivory to update that timeline position.
