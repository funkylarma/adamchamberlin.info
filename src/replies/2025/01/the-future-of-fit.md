Whilst reading Ray's article on how the EU's latest legislation is essentially going to kill off the Ant+ protocol it got me thinking about the recent flurry of EU mandated changes.

Personally, I am all for changes that make sense. Yes, protect my privacy and make sure all my devices are USB-C but at least give me an option to pick my battles. This change feels like it could obsolete more devices than the padlock icon will protect.

I use Ant+ and accept someone could 'listen' in on my heart rate, I'm fine with that.
