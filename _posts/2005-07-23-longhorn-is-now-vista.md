[[Microsoft]] have released the new name for it’s upcoming [[OS]]; Longhorn, it will now be known as Windows Vista. Longhorn has been in the pipe line for a while and whilst rumoured it should be realesed some time in 2156! Only joking but the time scale has been put back and back whilst they concentrate on ‘fixing’ existing [[Windows]] versions.
The plan is for Beta1 of Vista to be released first part of August with Beta2 beginning part of next year and I final release towrds the end of 2006.
This new version of [[Windows]] is being interface lead, hence the name; ‘pleasing view’ and will see a lot of interesting features based around the user and their experiences. Only time will tell that the minimum requirements for this version will be but expect to have to purchase a new machine to run it ;)
