no not this page, you must be joking! But I have created my first site that passed with flying colours.
OK it’s not much and no big deal but it does make you feel better when the Validator comes back with that nice green bar. For most of the day I have been working on a new site for Oscar Products (the place I work) and thought it would be nice to make it all valid now, it looks good from a business point of view, ‘bit like Investors in People for web sites’ as it was explained. So plugging away and using a trail version of Dreamweaver8 as a nice handy local validator finally the pages that are viewable so far are all reporting full XHTML1.0 valid, even the CSS file is sorted!
