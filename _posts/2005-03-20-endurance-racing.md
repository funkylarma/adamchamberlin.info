Gravy2012 and I had a quick go on the Logitech wheel over the week end. Well a quick go soon turned into about an evening’s worth. Add some beer and ales to the situation and as you can imagine we soon ended up making a night of it.
The real reason for the extended ‘testing’ of the wheel was the simple fact that it is so god damn good! I was expecting some nice feedback from the reviews I have read, deep down I was expecting some decent feedback from the price I paid for the wheel. I was not disapointed at all, the feedback is unreal, the device really does make you feel like you are connected to the car.
I’m going to have a look into this and do a full review for DAO
