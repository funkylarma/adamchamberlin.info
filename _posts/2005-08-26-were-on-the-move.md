If only everything in life was simple and planned it would be so much easier, a lot more boring and no where near as excititing but least you would have some direction to things.
If life was like this you might have more than 3 days notice you were moving house!
Those of you who know me or read the blog know that Lucy and I have been looking at buying a house as the future of our current residency is uncertain, well the news came through that we would have new landlords for the 1st September.
This seemed like the right time to move on to pastures new, if by luck the house we had looked at buying a month or so back is now up for rent. So some quick paperwork was drawn up and hopefully we get the keys tomorrow morning giving us three days to pack up and move.
Nothing like forward planning…
